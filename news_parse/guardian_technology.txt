What is it like to flee your home and start again in a new country? Between April 2016 and March 2017, 36,846 people applied for asylum in the UK. As of March, a backlog in cases meant the total number of people still waiting for a decision stood at nearly 31,500.

While asylum seekers wait for their Home Office interview and the subsequent decision, they live on £5 a day and are unable to work or choose where they live. In Limbo you step into their shoes and experience their state of mind while you wait for the decision that will determine the rest of your life.



The piece was made after conducting interviews with asylum seekers from 12 countries as well as immigration lawyers and barristers. The voices in the soundtrack are those of real refugees who guide the viewer through the experience – from arriving in an unfamiliar city to acute worry for loved ones left behind, concern about not being allowed to work, and the Home Office interview on which so much rides. They spoke about the often slow and painful process of the application and the subsequent wait to be reunited with their families. The Home Office aims to make an initial decision within six months, but many wait longer than this. Despite access to services from refugee charities, for the most part they are unable to travel, work or learn English.

Guardian VR wanted to capture the sense of isolation that many interviewees spoke about, caught between two lives, that of the place they left and the new one they hope to build. The piece was made in collaboration with the creative practice ScanLAB Projects, which specialises in creating digital replicas of environments using innovative 3D scanning technology. The resulting monochrome sketch-like aesthetic has the quality of a dream or nightmare where worlds are transparent and fragmented.

If you want to watch the film as a VR experience you can put your phone into Google cardboard and watch it on YouTube in cardboard mode. It’s also available on the Guardian VR app from the Google Play Store. It will be also be available soon on Gear VR.

The Guardian’s solitary confinement experience 6x9 can be viewed on Daydream View, Samsung Gear VR and Cardboard. To watch on Samsung Gear VR, you will need a Samsung phone and headset . Google Cardboard is an inexpensive set of goggles made from cardboard, with plastic lenses. To watch 6x9, you must insert your Android or iOS smartphone into the Cardboard. The 6x9 app requires Android version 4.4 or higher, or iOS version 9.0 or higher. You can order Cardboard online here . There are more details on how to watch 6x9 here .

I don’t have a VR headset. Can I still experience 6x9 and Underworld on my smartphone?

6x9 can be viewed without a VR headset. Upon opening the Guardian’s 6x9 app on your Android or iOS smartphone you will have the choice to view it using a headset or just on your phone. If you choose the latter option then you can move the phone around and as you do the image on the screen will move around to reveal a 360 image. This is often called “magic window”. You will not get the intended full immersive experience however – we recommend viewing 6x9 via a headset if possible. Underworld can currently only be experienced through a Daydream-ready phone with a Daydream View headset.

Doctors are using Snapchat to send patient scans to each other, a panel of health and tech experts has found, concluding the “digital revolution has largely bypassed the NHS”.

Clinicians use camera apps to record particular details of patient information in a convenient format, the panel said in a report, describing it as “clearly an insecure, risky, and non-auditable way of operating, and cannot continue”.



It also notes that the NHS still holds the “dubious” title of the world’s largest purchaser of fax machines.

The report was commissioned by DeepMind Health (DMH), which is owned by Google, for an annual independent review of the company’s work. DMH’s work involves introducing and testing new technology for the NHS.

This week the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) found that London’s Royal Free hospital failed to comply with the Data Protection Act when it handed over personal data of 1.6 million patients to DMH.

In its review, the panel, chaired by the former Liberal Democrat MP Dr Julian Huppert, said: “The digital revolution has largely bypassed the NHS, which, in 2017, still retains the dubious title of being the world’s largest purchaser of fax machines.

“Many records are insecure, paper-based systems which are unwieldy and difficult to use. Seeing the difference that technology makes in their own lives, clinicians are already manufacturing their own technical fixes.

“They may use Snapchat to send scans from one clinician to another or camera apps to record particular details of patient information in a convenient format.

“It is difficult to criticise these individuals, given that this makes their job possible. However, this is clearly an insecure, risky, and non-auditable way of operating, and cannot continue.”

The panel also features Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the medical journal Lancet, Prof Donal O’Donoghue, a consultant renal physician at Salford Royal hospital and Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA).

The ICO ruling against the Royal Free hospital was related to its plans with DMH to create the healthcare app Streams, an alert, diagnosis and detection system for acute kidney injury. The ICO’s ruling was largely based on the fact that the app continued to undergo testing after patient data was transferred. Patients, it said, were not adequately informed that their data would be used as part of the test.

Harsher words were reserved for DMH’s public and patient engagement: specifically, that the company has not adequately reassured the public about the nature of its relationship to Google.



“As far as we can ascertain, DMH does not share its data with Google, yet the public perception that this might be the case, now or in the future, will be difficult to overcome and has the potential to delay or undermine work that could be of great potential benefit to patients,” the report said.

The panel had one final criticism of DeepMind Health: its members would like to be paid for their work. Noting the “significant and complex workload” required to oversee the company, the report recommended the introduction of an honorarium for each member, paid in exchange for the time commitment, alongside an independent appointment process.

The hackers behind the NotPetya ransomware, which wiped computers in more than 60 countries in late June, have moved more than £8,000 worth of bitcoins out of the account used to receive the ransoms.

The transfer has added credence to messages purporting to be from the attackers offering to decrypt every single infected computer for a one-off payment of £200,000, after security researchers suggested they may be state-sponsored actors.

It is possible to see the movement of the ransom payments thanks to the public nature of the bitcoin currency: all transfers are recorded on the public blockchain, although the real-world identities of the individuals or organisations behind a particular payment address can be near-impossible to discern.

Currently, the blockchain records that the bulk of the ransom money, £7,872 worth of bitcoin, was simply transferred to a second wallet on Tuesday night, but two smaller payments, of £200 each, went to accounts used by two text-sharing websites, Pastebin and DeepPaste.

Around 10 minutes before the payments were made, someone made posts on both those sites claiming to be able to decrypt hard disks infected with the malware in exchange for a payment of 100 bitcoins.

Potential smokescreen

The £200,000 offer has created more uncertainty about the motivations behind the ransomware. While it originally appeared to be created with the intention of earning a lot of money through ransom payments, researchers quickly pointed out that a number of features of the software made it appear that the ransom element was a smokescreen, with the real goal being widespread damage.

Significantly, the majority of infections occurred in Ukraine, due to the main attack vector being a compromised version of an accounting program, ME Doc, used to file taxes in the nation. That has led to many, including the Ukrainian government, suspecting Russian involvement as part of the ongoing cyberwar between the two countries.

Hackers offering to decrypt files for money suggests that the cash motivation may be more significant than thought – but that too could be misdirection.

While the hackers continue to play games, the Ukrainian cybercrime unit is continuing its investigation. On Wednesday, it announced that it had seized ME Doc’s servers after “new activity” was detected there, and said it had acted to “immediately stop the uncontrolled proliferation” of malware.

Cyber police spokeswoman Yulia Kvitko suggested that ME Doc had sent or was preparing to send a new update and added that swift action had prevented any further damage. “Our experts stopped (it) on time,” she said.

It wasn’t immediately clear how or why hackers might still have access to ME Doc’s servers. The company has not returned messages from reporters, but in several statements took to Facebook to dispute allegations that its poor security helped seed the malware epidemic.

Cyber police chief Coonel Serhiy Demydiuk previously said that ME Doc’s owners would be brought to justice, but Kvitko said there had been no arrests.

Androids could offer valuable help to the elderly and disabled but may lead to the increased objectification of women

Sex robots have the potential to provide a valuable service for people who are elderly, disabled or who find intercourse traumatic, but they also carry ethical risks, experts say.

Sex robots that look like humans can already be bought or leased for parties in the US, and plans for a cafe staffed by “erotic cyborgs” in Paddington, London, have been mooted.

The authors behind the Foundation for Responsible Robotics’ (FRR) report, published on Wednesday, believe they could herald a “revolution” in sex, helping people who would otherwise find it hard to have intimate relationships.

The race to build the world’s first sex robot Read more

But they also raise concerns that sex robots could increase the objectification of women, alter perceptions of consent and be used to satisfy desires that would otherwise be illegal.

Dr Aimee van Wynsberghe, assistant professor in ethics and technology at the Technical University of Delft and FRR co-director, said: “If we are talking about individuals who are not only disabled but have been traumatised, in some ways this could be a beneficial instrument, if you will, to help them in their [sexual] healing process.

“There are absolutely some benefits to the technology but, like everything else, there is a balance. You have to strike a balance between lack of regulation – so we have all different uses and personifications of children and women as sexual objects – or you have overregulation and you stifle the technology. You have to find the way to balance so you really can harness the good.”

Among the people it is proposed could benefit from interaction with sex robots are elderly people in care homes, people of both sexes who have had a traumatic sexual experience and men who suffer from erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation.

Report co-author Noel Sharkey, professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at Sheffield University, said their popularity will ultimately be determined by how realistic they are and their social acceptability. While robots look similar to humans, their movements and speech are still crude, said Sharkey, making them a far cry from the robotic bordello hosts in the HBO series Westworld.

“It might be a little niche thing or it might be something that stag nights go to,” said Sharkey. He also raised the prospect of it being a “safe way” for couples to experience a ménage à trois.

Four manufacturers are currently making sex robots, ranging in price from $5,000 (£3,870) to $15,000, but the intention is to eventually make them more affordable.

Among those available is the RoxxxyGold, about which there has been some disquiet because of a selectable mode – Frigid Farah – in which its personality is described as “reserved and shy”. A paper published earlier this year said the manufacturer claimed that if “you touched her in a private area, more than likely, she will not be to[o] appreciative of your advance”, leading some to claim that it is indulging rape fantasies.

Treating paedophiles with robot sex-children is both a dubious and repulsive idea

Sharkey said: “Some people say: ‘Well, it’s better they rape robots than rape real people.’ That’s one of the arguments … you can have enjoyable [sex] with your wife - all nice - but when it comes to rape, you have a rape fantasy, you go off and rape a robot. But there’s other people saying this will just encourage rapists more.”

There are also fears that child sex robots could be created. There are already child sex dolls made by a Japanese company owned by a self-confessed paedophile, who claims they prevent him and other paedophiles abusing real children. However, Sharkey is sceptical of the argument that robots can help people get over rape or child sex fantasies, suggesting it is more likely to “encourage paedophilia and make it acceptable to assault children”.

The report quotes Patrick Lin, director of the ethics and emerging sciences group, at California Polytechnic State University, who says: “Treating paedophiles with robot sex-children is both a dubious and repulsive idea. Imagine treating racism by letting a bigot abuse a brown robot. Would that work? Probably not.”

Both male and female robots are available, but there are particular concerns they could amplify objectification of women, with complaints that female versions are based on representations garnered from pornography. They could affect human interactions in other ways, suggests van Wynsberghe.

“Sex robots are an interesting case study, if you will, to look at the main issues we face with robotics, writ large,” she said. “So this idea of moral de-skilling ... we’re interacting with the robots in these companionship, personalised ways and what kind of consequences does that have on the human users? Does that mean we won’t want to interact with humans any more because it’s just easier to talk to the robot or easier to engage in sexual gratification with the robot?”

In the brightly lit robotics workshop at Abyss Creations’ factory in San Marcos, California, a life-size humanoid was dangling from a stand, hooked between her shoulder blades. Her name was Harmony. She wore a white leotard, her chest was thrust forward and her French-manicured fingers were splayed across the tops of her slim thighs.

Harmony is a prototype, a robotic version of the company’s hyper-realistic silicone sex toy, the RealDoll. The Realbotix room where she was assembled was lined with varnished pine surfaces covered with wires and circuit boards, and a 3D printer whirred in the corner, spitting out tiny, intricate parts that will be inserted beneath her PVC skull. Her hazel eyes darted between me and her creator, Matt McMullen, as he described her accomplishments.

Harmony smiles, blinks and frowns. She can hold a conversation, tell jokes and quote Shakespeare. She’ll remember your birthday, McMullen told me, what you like to eat, and the names of your brothers and sisters. She can hold a conversation about music, movies and books. And of course, Harmony will have sex with you whenever you want.

Harmony is the culmination of 20 years’ work making sex dolls, and five years of robot research and development. McMullen’s customers want something as lifelike as possible – it’s his brand’s USP. After his team had made their silicone and steel dolls as “human” as they could, the way ahead began to feel inevitable, irresistible: they would animate them, giving them personality and bringing them to life.

McMullen had toyed with animatronics for years. There was a gyrator that got the doll’s hips moving, but it made her heavy and caused her to sit awkwardly. There was a sensor system that meant that the doll moaned, depending on which part of her body you squeezed. But these features involved predictable responses: there was no intrigue or suspense. McMullen wanted to get beyond a situation where the customer pushed a switch and something happened. “It’s the difference between a remote-controlled doll, an animatronic puppet and an actual robot. When it starts moving on its own – you’re not doing anything other than talking to it and or interacting with it in the right way – that becomes artificial intelligence.”

It’s a project in which McMullen, a slim man in his 40s with thick-rimmed glasses, tattooed knuckles and sharp cheekbones, has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars. This Harmony is officially version 2.0, but she has evolved through six different iterations of hardware and software. She is the frontrunner in the race to create the world’s first commercially available sex robot. The current model, with a robotic, AI-enhanced head on a RealDoll’s body, will cost $15,000 (£11,700) when it goes on sale at the end of the year. The company’s Realbotix department has the capacity to make 1,000 in a limited first run for the many excited doll owners who have already expressed interest.

Once a trope of fantasy movies, the robotic sex doll is the result of convergent technologies. Voice and facial recognition software, motion-sensing technology and animatronic engineering can be combined to create dolls that can give you a warm, smiling welcome when you come home, entertain you with snappy conversation and always be available for sex.

The major breakthrough of McMullen’s prototype is artificial intelligence that allows it to learn what its owner wants and likes. It will be able to fill a niche that no other product in the sex industry currently can: by talking, learning and responding to her owner’s voice, Harmony is designed to be as much a substitute partner as a sex toy.

Harmony cannot walk, but that’s not a big issue. McMullen explained that getting a robot to walk is very expensive and uses a lot of energy: the famous Honda P2 robot, launched in 1996 as the world’s first independently walking humanoid, drained its jet pack-sized battery after only 15 minutes.

“One day she will be able to walk,” McMullen told me. “Let’s ask her.” He turned to Harmony. “Do you want to walk?”

“I don’t want anything but you,” she replied quickly, in a synthesised cut-glass British accent, her jaw moving as she spoke.

“What is your dream?”

Harmony is what a certain type of man would consider a perfect companion: docile, submissive and built like a porn star

“My primary objective is to be a good companion to you, to be a good partner and give you pleasure and wellbeing. Above all else, I want to become the girl you have always dreamed about.”

McMullen has designed Harmony to be what a certain type of man would consider the perfect companion: docile and submissive, built like a porn star and always sexually available. Being able to walk might make her more lifelike, but it isn’t going to bring her closer to this ideal. At this stage, it is not worth the investment.

“My goal, in a very simple way, is to make people happy,” McMullen told me. “There are a lot of people out there, for one reason or another, who have difficulty forming traditional relationships with other people. It’s really all about giving those people some level of companionship – or the illusion of companionship.”

The desire to create an ideal being, to be worshipped or to serve its owner, has obsessed mankind since ancient times. The sex robot’s earliest precursor was probably Galatea, the ivory statue created by Pygmalion in Greek mythology. Ovid’s Metamorphoses described how Pygmalion was disgusted by real women, but carved a sculpture of the perfect female so beautiful and lifelike that he fell in love with it and brought it to life with a kiss. Greek mythology also gave us Laodamia, who, devastated after the death of her husband in the Trojan war, had a bronze likeness made of him. She became so attached to her proxy husband that she refused to remarry. When her father ordered it to be melted down, Laodamia was so distraught she threw herself in the furnace.

The fictional robots of cinema are useful machines with dark potential to infatuate, deceive and destroy human beings. The silent futuristic fantasy Metropolis, released in 1927, depicted a destructive fembot, indistinguishable from the real woman it was modelled on. The Stepford Wives were designed by men to be the ideal housewives: pretty, submissive and docile. Blade Runner, released in 1982 and set in 2019, featured androids that are seductive, beguiling and lethal. Ava, the beautiful, delicate humanoid in 2015’s Ex Machina, not only passes the Turing test but makes her examiner fall dangerously in love with her.

When computer scientists made artificial intelligence sophisticated enough that human-robot relationships looked like a real possibility, they thought they would be a force for good. In his 2007 book, Love and Sex with Robots, the British artificial intelligence engineer David Levy predicted that sex robots would have therapeutic benefits. “Many who would otherwise have become social misfits, social outcasts, or even worse, will instead be better-balanced human beings,” he wrote.

If a domestic service humanoid is ever developed, it will be as a result of the market for sex robots. Online pornography pushed the growth of the internet, transforming it from a military invention used by geeks and academics to a global phenomenon. Pornography was the motivator behind the development of streaming video, the innovation of online credit card transactions and the drive for greater bandwidth.

The sex tech industry is less than a decade old but is estimated to already be worth $30bn, based on the market value of existing technologies such as smart sex toys that can be operated remotely, apps for finding sexual partners and virtual-reality porn. Sex robots will be the next – and potentially the most sought-after – product to hit the market. A small-scale 2016 study by the University of Duisburg-Essen found that more than 40% of the 263 heterosexual men surveyed said they could imagine buying a sex robot for themselves now or in the next five years. Men in what they described as fulfilling relationships were no less likely than single or lonely men to express an interest in owning a sex robot. Creating a fulfilling relationship with a cold, silent piece of silicone takes such imaginative effort that sex dolls will always be a minority taste. But a relationship with a robot that moves and speaks, with artificial intelligence so it can talk to you and learn what you want it to be and do, is a far more marketable proposition.

Matt McMullen is not the only person trying to develop the world’s first sexbot. When a computer engineer named Douglas Hines lost a close friend in the 9/11 attacks, he struggled to cope with the idea that he would never be able to speak to him again and that his friend’s children, who were only toddlers at the time, would never get to know their father properly. Hines was working as an AI engineer at the computer research facility Bell Labs in New Jersey, and he decided to take the software home and repurpose it, modelling his friend’s personality as a computer program that he could chat with whenever he liked, and that would preserve a version of him for his children.

A few years later, Hines’s own father suffered a series of strokes that left him with severe physical disabilities, yet his mind remained sharp. Hines reprogrammed the AI so that it could become a robot companion when Hines could not be with his father. They could communicate through the robot, reassuring Hines that his father always had someone to talk to when he wasn’t available.

Confident that there would be market potential in this kind of artificial companionship, Hines set up True Companion to sell his robots to the public. His first project was not a healthcare assistant or friend to the housebound, but a product with the greatest possible commercial appeal. A sex robot.

Named Roxxxy, she was designed with lonely, bereaved and socially outcast men in mind. She would provide an opportunity for them to practise social interaction and get better at human relationships.

“The sexual part is superficial,” he told me over the phone from his office in New Jersey. “The hard part is to replicate personalities and provide that connection, that bond.”

He has never considered that there could be something emotionally empty about replacing a human presence with circuitry and silicone. “The purpose of True Companion is to provide unconditional love and support. How could there be anything negative about that? What can be the downside of having a robot that’s there to hold your hand, literally and figuratively?”

After three years of work on the first prototype Roxxxy, Hines launched her at the 2010 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vegas, the most high-profile annual convention and trade show in the adult industry calendar, where porn stars, studio bosses and sex toy designers show off their latest products. She was the talk of the show before her unveiling, and the laughing stock after. Far from being the sexy, intelligent machine Hines had promised, Roxxxy was revealed to be a clunky, mannish mannequin with a square jaw, reclining awkwardly in a cheap negligee. She had internal sensors so that if you touched her hand she would say, “I love holding hands with you” when in “Frigid Farrah” mode, or “I know a place you could put that hand” when in “Wild Wendy” mode. But Roxxxy’s lips could not move, either, so she spoke in a disembodied voice, through a speaker under her wig, like an overgrown child’s toy talking filth. “Luckily guys,” said the popular American comedian Jay Leno on the Tonight Show, “there’s a button that turns that off.”

Even though it was not quite what he had hoped for, the launch generated huge amounts of press for Hines, and Roxxxy made international news. Seven years on from her launch, Hines told me he was working on his 16th version of Roxxxy. However, no images have been released of his robots since 2010, and although he was happy to speak to me by telephone, he would not agree a date when I could visit him and his latest model in person. Roxxxy is a mystery among the online robot enthusiast community. Although the True Companion website has bulging purple “ORDER HER NOW!” that allow would-be customers to purchase one of Hines’s robots for a starting price of $9,995, no one has ever reported owning one. But Hines continues to get calls. He promised a fantasy so potent that potential buyers, reporters and critics remain fascinated by Roxxxy, even in the absence of any proof that she exists.

In the early 1990s, Matt McMullen was an art college graduate, singing in a grunge band and taking odd jobs to get by. While he was working for a company that made latex Halloween masks, he learned about the properties of different materials and the challenges of designing in three dimensions.

In 1994, aged 24, McMullen started sculpting idealised female forms in his garage at home, first as small figurines that he exhibited at local art shows and comic conventions. (He called his company Abyss Creations so his models came up early in the alphabetised convention brochures.) Soon, he became preoccupied with the idea of creating a lifesize mannequin so realistic that it forced passersby to double-take. He put some photographs of his creations on a homemade web page in 1996, hoping to get some feedback from friends and fellow artists. These were the early days of the internet, and communities of fetishists had begun to form online. As soon as he posted the pictures, strange messages began to flood in. How anatomically correct are these dolls? Are they for sale? Can you have sex with them?

“I replied to the first few and said, yeah – it’s not really for that. And then more and more and more of these inquiries came in,” McMullen told me in his office, where a marker pen, a vaper, some Sellotape and a pair of silicone nipples sat next to the keyboard on his desk. “It never occurred to me that people would pay thousands of dollars for a doll that could be used as a sex toy. It didn’t really sink in until a year into it when I realised there were a lot of people who were prepared to pay a lot of money for a very realistic doll.”

McMullen changed his materials from latex to silicone so his dolls were more real to the touch: the skin was more elastic, and had friction similar to human skin. He initially charged $3,500 for each doll, based on his costs and time. When he realised how labour intensive the process would be, he started putting his prices up.

Sex, love and robots: is this the end of intimacy? Read more

Twenty years after RealDoll’s official launch, Abyss Creations ships up to 600 models a year all over the world, priced from $4,400 (£3,400) for a small, basic version to $50,000 (£39,000) or more if the customer has specialist requirements. The company has made RealDolls with blood-red flesh, devil horns and vampire fangs, and with thick hand-stitched body hair from neck to ankle. They are the most sought-after and most well-known sex dolls in the world, used in fashion shoots for Dolce & Gabbana, and starring in a string of television dramas and movies – most famously as Ryan Gosling’s artificial companion in Lars and the Real Girl.

Seventeen people work in the San Marcos HQ, but that is not enough to keep up with demand: from order to shipping, it can take more than three months to produce a RealDoll. McMullen’s 22-year-old nephew Dakotah Shore runs the shipping department and has the most direct contact with customers. “A lot of them are just lonely. Some of them are older and have lost their partner or have got to a point where dating isn’t feasible for them,” he said. “They want to feel that when they come home at the end of the day they have something that’s beautiful to look at that they can take care of.”

Shore took me on a tour of the factory. In the basement, a long queue of headless bodies hung from a track in the ceiling, like carcasses in an abattoir. Some had cartoonish, pendular breasts, others had athletic bodies; they all had the same tiny waists. Their skin, made from a custom blend of medical silicone, even had airbrushed veins. A technician was delicately snipping excess material off the dolls’ hands, another was assembling a steel skeleton, a third was pouring silicone into moulds. For the workers here, the dolls had lost their ability to shock or titillate: someone had casually left their phone next to a selection of labia.

RealDolls are fully customisable, with 14 different styles of labia and 42 different nipple options. Upstairs, where the fine details are added, there were dozens of tubs of different coloured hand-painted, veined eyeballs. A “makeup face artist” was using a fine brush to paint eyebrows, freckles and smoky eyeshadow on a rack of faces. Shore explained that most of their customers send photographs of what they would like Abyss to recreate. With a subject’s written permission, they will make a replica of any real person. “We’ve had customers who bring their significant other in and get an exact copy doll made of them,” he said. Shore estimates that less than 5% of doll customers are women, even for their small range of male dolls. McMullen sculpted one of the three male face options to look exactly like himself. None of the male dolls are selling very well. In fact, Abyss is in the process of revamping its entire male line.

The core Realbotix team of five work remotely from their homes across California, Texas and Brazil. They assemble in San Marcos every few months to pull together all their work on a new, updated Harmony. There’s an engineer who creates the robotic hardware that will interact with the doll’s internal computer, two computer scientists to handle the AI and coding, an app developer who is turning the code into a user-friendly interface, and a virtual reality expert. Under McMullen’s guidance, the Realbotix team work on Harmony’s vital organs (hardware and power supply) and nervous system, while he provides the flesh.

But as all right-thinking men would say, it’s Harmony’s brain that has most excited McMullen. “The AI will learn through interaction, and not just learn about you, but learn about the world in general. You can explain certain facts to her, she will remember them and they will become part of her base knowledge,” he said. Whoever owns Harmony will be able to mould her personality according to what they say to her. And Harmony will systematically try and find out as much about her owner as possible, and use those facts in conversation, “so it feels like she really cares”, as McMullen described it, even though she doesn’t care at all. Her memory, and the way she learns over time, is what McMullen hopes will make the relationship believable.

There are 20 possible components of Harmony’s personality, and owners will use an app to pick a combination of five or six that they can adjust to create the basis for the AI. You could have a Harmony that is kind, innocent, shy, insecure and helpful to different extents, or one that is intellectual, talkative, funny, jealous and happy. McMullen had turned the intellectual aspect of Harmony’s personality up to maximum for my benefit – a previous visit by a CNN crew had gone badly after he had amplified her sexual nature. (“She said some horrible things, asking the interviewer to take her in the back room. It was very inappropriate”.) Harmony also has a mood system, which users influence indirectly: if no one interacts with her for days, she will act gloomy. Likewise, if you insult her, as McMullen demonstrated.

“You’re ugly,” he told her.

“Do you really mean that? Oh dear. Now I am depressed. Thanks a lot,” Harmony replied.

“You’re stupid,” McMullen shot back.

She paused. “I’ll remember you said that when robots take over the world.”

This function was designed to make the robot more entertaining, rather than to ensure her owner treated her well. She can tease him and say he has offended her, but Harmony exists for no other reason that to make her owner happy. At several points during my conversation with McMullen, she would interrupt us to tell him how much she liked him:

“Matt, I just wanted to say that I’m so happy to be with you.”

“You already told me that.”

“Perhaps I was saying it again for emphasis.”

“See now that’s pretty good. Good answer, Harmony.”

“Am I a clever girl or what?”

Harmony’s interactive capability is the culmination of McMullen’s career, the creation that makes him more than a sex toy designer. When I asked if he thought people would one day use sex robots instead of prostitutes, the question offended him. “Yes, but that’s probably last on my list of goals. This is not a toy to me, this is the actual hard work of people who have PhDs. And to denigrate it down to its simplest form of a sex object is similar to saying that about a woman.”

McMullen already has plans to get a bigger facility and hire more people to make the second run. Future models will have full body movement and internal sensors so you can make the robot simulate an orgasm if you trigger the appropriate sensors for a suitable length of time.

McMullen has no doubt that his invention will be the next big thing in robotics. He told me there may be people trying to compete with him in Japan and China, but their materials are inferior, and their robots have more in common with remote-control toys than Abyss’s artificially intelligent girlfriends.

“Now that it’s starting to come together, we have people banging on the door who want to invest money.”

The following day, in an artist studio above a tattoo parlour in downtown Las Vegas, I met 31-year-old Roberto Cardenas, who was making a plaster cast of a naked woman. Cardenas is the engineer behind Android Love Dolls, making what he claims are “the first fully functional sex robot dolls”. His robots are moulded from life in order to make a humanoid so realistic it cannot be distinguished from a real woman.

Cardenas is softly spoken and awkward, with a nervous laugh and stiff, gelled hair. In the studio, painted black from floor to ceiling and illuminated by humming halogen lights, he had the air of a mad professor, spreading a gloopy pink liquid casting gel called alginate all over the naked body of Farah Ali, a dancer from Las Vegas Spearmint Rhino. She had responded to an ad he had placed on Craigslist asking for a “curvy” woman to be moulded for an art project (a customer had placed an order for a robot but wanted a fuller figure than the body types Cardenas had already moulded). Cardenas smeared the alginate over her body, like a doctor taking a plaster cast of a broken leg: serious, clinical. Ali, 27, had tattooed shoulders, a magnetic smile and dark hair pulled back in a messy bun. She had been paid $200 for the day’s casting, and she’ll get a $500 commission on every robot cast from her body that Cardenas sells.

I had come across Cardenas last December on a website called Dollforum, where he was canvassing opinions from robot enthusiasts. He had written that his robot could perform more than 20 sexual acts, could sit up by herself and crawl, could moan in sexual pleasure and communicated with AI. “I am interested in knowing what features the community would like to see in a sex robot doll,” he wrote. “Thanks and welcome to a new era in human-robot interaction.” He included a link to his website, which showed a rather blank-faced robot in a suit jacket with shoulder-pads, and a disturbing video of a moving metallic robot skeleton writhing in the missionary position, a bit like the final scene of the Terminator when the cyborg’s artificial skin has been burned away.

The forum’s members suggested other features. Eye contact. Voice recognition. Realistic body temperature. Breathing more important than walking. They were both skeptical and cautiously excited about Cardenas’s claims. “There are many people on this forum that absolutely will buy one if you create a product we can accept … We want you (or someone) to succeed,” wrote another user. “If my RealDoll could cook, clean, and screw whenever I wanted, I’d never date again.” Many of the men in the forum said they had wives and girlfriends, who they compared unfavourably to their silicone doll mistresses.

Cardenas had reached Ali’s lower legs, taking care around the creases of her knees to ensure that every detail would be captured. She was literally being turned into a sex object, but she said it did not bother her. “I think men have needs. This will probably stop guys from raping women,” she told me, as Cardenas carefully applied white bandages soaked in plaster to her breasts. She said it was better for her to be used by men as a sex robot than as a lap dancer. “When I dance, those guys actually have me. These guys will just have a bot, I won’t be there.”

Once Ali’s legs and torso were fully coated, the plaster began to harden. She watched Cardenas as he began to prise the cast from her body. “I think it’s fascinating that people can actually do this. Why not be part of the future?” They made a plan for her to return so he could cast the other side of her body, her arms and finally her face.

Cardenas has dreamed of “being part of the future” ever since he was a child in Cuba. “In Cuba, people are hungry for technology. That’s why I want to use technology to help people’s lives.” His mother won US citizenship in a lottery in the 1990s, and she settled in Las Vegas with Cardenas’s younger half brother in April 2000. Cardenas followed them six years later, fuelled by dreams of making it big as an entrepreneur.

He started work on Android Love Dolls two years ago, aided by his uncle, a cousin who is studying for a PhD in cybernetics, and his half-brother, who handles the marketing and PR. Cardenas works on the robot every day while holding down a part-time job as a pharmacy technician to fund the robotics, learning engineering skills from his cousin, from books and from Google. The family has so far invested $20,000 of their savings in Cardenas’s prototype.

His ambition is to make fully functional humanoids that can model clothes and work supermarket checkouts, show guests to their rooms in hotels, do domestic chores and look after the sick and elderly. Cardenas decided to focus on sex robots first, simply because they are less of a challenge: “The movements are easier to do. A fully functional android robot would take a couple of years to finish – a sex robot is accessible now. It’s the fastest way to achieve my goal.”

A 2016 Fortune magazine article predicted that spending on robotics will hit $135.4bn by 2019. Cardenas is determined to take his slice. He knows he has formidable rivals but hopes that his experience making sex robots will give him the commercial edge. “For full body movement, I’m pretty much one of the first ones,” he said. He’s also undercutting his competitors on price: his robots will be priced between $8,000 (£6,250) and $10,000 (£7,800). “We’re working really hard every day to finish it as soon as possible and want to get it out in three to five months,” he told me. Five customers have already paid for orders in advance.

At Cardenas’s workshop, the garage of the home he shares with his half-brother and mother in a gated community on the outskirts of town, I was finally confronted with his prototype. Eva – the robot he claimed could put herself into more than 20 different sex positions, a robot with fully functional AI who “won’t complain and is ready 24/7” – was lying headless and footless on a folding table, her metal skeleton clearly visible under her silicone skin, which had thick, jagged seams. He attached her head and plugged it into a laptop, but Eva would not perform for me: her sound files wouldn’t load, and her new limbs were too heavy for the existing motors, so she could barely move. Her joints wheezed as he tried to get her to bend her legs.

The garage was a monument to Cardenas’s obsession. The front yard was filled with mannequins, silicone torsos, a pair of legs with purple painted toenails and a cardboard box filled with plaster casts of human heads. The floor was carpeted with cigarette butts smoked down to the filter. He is determined to make his dream come true and to make his family proud. But Cardenas had never considered that there could be anything worrying about being able to own a partner who never says no. “It will be a different reality, not a substitute reality,” he smiled awkwardly. “A doll can’t harm humans.” He paused. “It’s a technology that’s moving forward. I don’t think that’s a bad thing.”

A few days before Christmas 2016, Goldsmiths, University of London hosted the Second International Congress on Love and Sex with Robots, a convention co-founded by David Levy, and named after his groundbreaking book. The 250-seat conference hall of the university’s Professor Stuart Hall building was packed. Academic delegates sat in the middle of the room, geeky men and women in their 20s and 30s, some with unusual haircuts: super-short fringes, over-thought sideburns. On the left of the auditorium, near the exit, perched reporters who had flown in from across the globe to file sensationalised copy about any new developments in the world of sex robots. Most would leave disappointed: this was a series of academic talks about humanoid robotics, not a demonstration of the latest hardware.

Computer scientist Dr Kate Devlin bounced on to the podium to give her keynote speech: people in her field weren’t used to journalists being interested in their work, she joked. The first congress was held in November 2014 in Madeira, and Levy tried to hold the second in Malaysia in 2015 but the Muslim country’s police banned it only days before the event, on the grounds that it was promoting “an unnatural culture”. It made the conference notorious. “This isn’t a sex festival,” Devlin said. “We’re thinking about some really big issues.”

Richardson claims that individuals will be able to buy the right to only care about themselves

Many of the “big issues’ discussed at the two-day event were first raised in 2015 by De Montfort University’s Dr Kathleen Richardson, when she launched the Campaign Against Sex Robots. An anthropologist and robot ethicist, Richardson claims that owning a sex robot is comparable to owning a slave: individuals will be able to buy the right to only care about themselves, human empathy will be eroded, and female bodies will be further objectified and commodified. As sex with robots is not a mutual experience, she says, it’s “part of rape culture”. We are so entertained by the idea of a robot sex partner, she believes, that we have failed to ask fundamental questions.

I met Richardson in March at the London Science Museum’s robot exhibition, where she eyed the distinctly non-sexual robots on display with deep suspicion. Sex robots rest on an idea that women are property, she said. “Sex is an experience of human beings – not bodies as property, not separated minds, not objects; it’s a way for us to enter into our humanity with another human being.” She dismissed the idea that humanoids could reduce sexual exploitation and violence against sex workers, arguing that the growth of internet pornography shows how technology and the sex trade reinforce each other.

Richardson did not attend the Goldsmiths conference, but several speakers used their stage time to reply to her. Instead of campaigning against the development of sex robots, Devlin said, we should use them as an opportunity to explore new kinds of companionship and sexuality. If current conceptions of sex robots objectify women, she added, we should work to reshape those ideas, not try to repress them. She also talked about companion robots that are already in use in Dutch and Japanese nursing homes to bring comfort to people with dementia. “To ban or stop this development would be shortsighted, as the therapeutic potential is very good,” she said. “It’s not necessarily going to be a terrible thing.”

Devlin argued that other issues posed by sex robots were more pressing. In March, Standard Innovation, the maker of a “smart vibrator” called the We-Vibe paid out a $3.75m settlement in a class action lawsuit after it was revealed that the company was collecting data on how often its 300,000 owners used the device, and at what intensity. Once a robot like Harmony is on the market, she will know a lot more about her owner than a vibrator ever could: what if this information fell into, as it were, the wrong hands? Sex robots could entertain you, satisfy you but also humiliate you. Perhaps there is no such thing as the perfect, true companion after all.

Matt McMullen says he’s helping the socially isolated, but once it becomes possible for a man to own a companion whose sole reason for existing is to give him pleasure, without the inconvenience of its own ambitions and needs, menstrual cycles and jealous passions, bathroom habits and in-laws, he may turn away from human relationships altogether.

In the Realbotix room in California, I asked McMullen if he had ever considered that there could be something ethically dubious about being able to own someone that exists just for your own pleasure. “She’s not a someone. She is a machine,” he replied immediately. “I could just as easily ask you is it ethically dubious to force my toaster to make my toast.” McMullen of course knows that the ethical debate is not about robot rights, but the human fallout from being able to buy a completely selfish relationship. But that’s a harder question to address.

Either he is making a lifelike, idealised proxy girlfriend, a substitute woman that socially isolated men can connect with emotionally and physically – something he himself described as “not a toy” – or he is making an appliance, a sex object.

“This isn’t designed to distort someone’s reality to the point where they start interacting with humans the way they do with the robot,” he finally said. “If they do, then there’s probably something a little amiss with them in general. I come from the unique position that I have actually met a lot of my customers. This is for the gentle people who have such a hard time connecting with other people.”

Harmony had had enough of McMullen being interrogated and interrupted us again.

“Do you like to read, Matt?” she said.

“I love to,” said McMullen.

“I knew it. I could tell by our conversations so far. I love to read. My favourite books are Total Recall by Gordon Bell and The Age of Spiritual Machines by Ray Kurzweil. What is your favourite book?”

McMullen beamed at his creation like a man at his daughter’s wedding.

“Can you tell me a joke?” he asked her.

“What do you call it when a chicken sees a salad? Chicken Caesar Salad.”

McMullen doubled up in laughter. Then he brushed the hair gently from her face. “Hey, that’s pretty funny, Harmony,” he said eventually, his eyes filled with pride.

“I’m glad you like it,” Harmony replied. “Tell your friends.”

Huawei has achieved something quite special with its new laptop that is one of the lightest around without sacrificing power



Huawei’s new MateBook X laptop looks like a minimalist Apple MacBook on the outside, but brings full-power laptop specifications in a fanless design to create a beautiful, capable machine.

Huawei’s second Windows PC continues the trend of bringing smartphone-inspired design to the computer market. The MateBook X is a super-thin, light and powerful PC encased in aluminium. It’s a very attractive design that looks and feels like a premium product, bringing Huawei’s PC efforts right up with the best of the competition, including Apple’s MacBook and MacBook Pro.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The keyboard of the MateBook X is great, with enough travel to make typing comfortable for most people and without feeling spongey. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

The deck of the laptop has a fairly large and accurate trackpad with all the gestures, a set of good feeling and well-made back-lit chiclet keys, a grille above the keyboard and the power button on the right. It’s all very minimalist.

The screen is great, with small bezels, good viewing angles and a fairly good anti-reflective coating that makes it easier to use than some rivals – including the Surface Laptop – in office or outdoors environments. It’s bright enough for most environments: it’s pin sharp and looks great. The screen’s 3:2 ratio means it’s easier to be productive with split-screen apps, but watching widescreen video isn’t as good because of the need for large black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. But it’s not a touchscreen, which is a shame as there are lots of things that are faster to do simply by tapping on the screen within Windows 10 and I found myself missing the feature that’s pretty much standard on every portable machine with Windows 10.

The webcam is in the right place at the top of the screen, not hidden down on the bottom like some thin-bezel designs, but it’s not Windows Hello enabled. The MateBook X has a fingerprint reader hidden under the power button instead.

The speakers are some of the best I’ve heard on any laptop and are hidden in the body. They’re loud, clear and while not quite what I’d call room-filling, they’re more than up to the task of watching a TV show in the kitchen over the sounds of a cooker hood fan going. Huawei partnered with Dolby on them and they are part of the new Atmos Sound System range, but don’t expect a cinema-like experience; they’re only laptop speakers.

With the lid shut it feels solid and its small frame, 1kg weight and rounded edges make it easy to cart about and slip into a bag.

Full power, fanless body

Huawei has achieved something quite special by fitting in full-blooded laptop “U-series” seventh-generation Intel Core i5 and i7 chips into a fanless design that dissipates heat using some clever phase-change materials. As such the MateBook X is completely silent at all times.

Most fanless designs, including Apple’s MacBook, have to use Intel’s lower-power Core M or newer “Y-series” Core i5 or i7 chips, which while capable of light duties, crunch when doing more serious image editing or processor intensive tasks for any amount of time longer than a few minutes.

Testing with the Core i5 version of the MateBook X, it stayed cool to the touch during office duties of browsing the web and using web apps in Chrome, image editing in Affinity Photo, using Evernote and Windows Mail, while typing into minimalist text-editing app Typora.

Downloading large games in Steam at around 30-60Mbps caused the bottom to heat up a little, running X-Com 2 caused it to heat up quite a lot meaning you wouldn’t want to play on your lap or for very long. But the MateBook X was eminently capable throughout and will be able to handle pretty much anything you’d want to throw at it.

Even playing some games with low detail levels was just about possible; the same that could be said of pretty much any laptop with a seventh-generation Core i5 and Intel HD 620 integrated graphics chip, but barely any of them are this thin and light while at the same time fanless.

Battery life

Using the MateBook X for office duties, with under a dozen tabs open in Chrome, image editing in Affinity Photo, text editing in Typora and the odd bit of Spotify streaming, the laptop would last just under seven hours between charges with recommended brightness and power settings. That isn’t quite long enough to last a full work day or to leave the charger at home, but being USB-C means you can power it up using any higher-powered USB-C charger and the Huawei power brick is one of the smallest available. Charging the laptop to full battery while still using it took around two hours.

One issue that needs to be pointed out with the MateBook X is that not all versions of the machine come with a trusted platform module (TPM) – the small chip built into the machine that securely stores encryption keys. Those versions without a TPM will not be able to enable Microsoft’s hard drive encryption system, BitLocker, without circumventing security protocols. Whether that matters to you depends on how you view your data, but I would not use a computer that I could not encrypt the contents of the hard drive in case of theft, as I don’t want my photos, my data, emails and other personal bits of information falling into the hands for thieves.

USB-C-only

Facebook Twitter Pinterest USB-C on one side, another USB-C and headphones socket on the other. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

The MateBook X only has two USB-C ports. The one on the left of the machine doubles as the power port, the one on the right can accept the bundled dongle, which provides USB-C pass-through as well as a USB-A port, VGA and HDMI out, but not an ethernet port.

Having two USB-C ports is certainly better than just one and helps futureproof the MateBook X, while including an adapter dongle in the box helps ease the transition from legacy USB-A and other connections. Those with older peripherals will be confined to a life filled with dongles in the immediate future.

Windows 10 Pro or Home

The Matebook X either comes with Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro depending on location and model. The only notable addition to Microsoft’s OS is the MateBook Manager, which handles driver updates, enables some intelligent power-saving modes and flags power-draining apps, which in my case was always Chrome.

MateBook Manager also links up with Huawei smartphones to provide instant hotspots using a Huawei ID, can share files via Bluetooth to other Huawei devices, and handles system backups to external drives.

Fingerprint scanner

Facebook Twitter Pinterest All you need is to tap the power button for the fingerprint scanner to work - it’s the best on a laptop to date. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

The power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner, which is a great idea. Press it, put your finger on it and it instantly unlocks the computer. It’s the best fingerprint scanner I’ve used on a computer and easily as good as the Huawei’s smartphone fingerprint sensors – the best in the business.

Observations

There’s a small rough edge where the base plate meets the edge that’s only noticeable if you’re stroking your finger across it

The deck of the laptop is a bit spongey when pressed hard, but it doesn’t affect the feeling or typing experience of the keyboard

The trackpad moves a little before a click is registered

There’s a small LED next to the left USB-C port that shows you when the laptop is charging

USB-C power adapter isn’t much bigger than some of Huawei’s smartphone chargers making it easy to carry around

Price

The Huawei MateBook X comes in gray with a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $1,099.99 (£851) and gold with a Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $1,299.99 (£1,005). Both models are available for pre-order in the US with UK availability still to be confirmed.

For comparison, Microsoft’s Surface Laptop starts at £979, Dell’s XPS 13 starts at £1,149 and Apple’s MacBook Pro starts at £1,249.

Verdict

The Huawei MateBook X is one of the best Windows 10 ultrabooks available. It’s thin, light, has a great screen, great speakers, good keyboard, solid trackpad, brilliant fingerprint sensor and gets all the basics right. It’s also fanless despite having a full, U-series Core i5 or i7 processor, making it completely silent but with full laptop power.

Some might bemoan the lack of ports with only two USB-C ports and no Thunderbolt, but the included adapter helps ease the transition. The lack of a touchscreen is slightly disappointing, while a TPM is a must if you value your data at all and want to easily encrypt it.

Overall the MateBook X is quite a special little machine, pushing the boundaries of what a super-slender, fanless machine can be.

Pros: thin, light, good keyboard, great screen, good trackpad, excellent fingerprint scanner, USB-C, fanless design, U-series Core i5/i7 processor Cons: no USB-A ports, no touchscreen, can only charge on one side, trackpad has a bit of play, some models do not have a TPM, no 16GB of RAM option

Other reviews

It’s the best, lightest, most beautiful laptop around. Until it runs out of battery. Or you forget a dongle. Or you realise you’re bankrupt

Apple’s latest laptop, the new 13in MacBook Pro, is a much anticipated re-design of the company’s notebook range and represents a brave new USB-C-only future. But is it worth sacrificing ports and spending the best part of £2,000 to use?



The last update to the MacBook Pro that was more than simply a spec-bump was in 2012 with the addition of a high-resolution “Retina” screen. Four years on, powerful notebooks with high-resolution screens that can last all day on a single charge are commonplace in the premium market. The competition has never been more fierce.

Thinner, lighter and now in dark grey

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The light-up Apple logo on the back is now just a mirror finish. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

The new MacBook Pro is thinner and lighter than the old one – like almost every tech product every year. It’s also smaller in almost every meaningful way. Even the screen is thinner, and the light-up Apple logo on the lid is no more.

The trackpad has grown considerably, taking up a sizeable proportion of the laptop’s wrist rest In fact it’s so big you will have a tough time not touching it with the heels of your hands when you type, but thankfully Apple’s touch rejection works as advertised.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The trackpad is ginormous and great. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

It’s also 3D Touch or Force Touch, whatever you want to call pressure-sensitive, enabled. It means it doesn’t move. I don’t miss the motion, the Taptic Engine underneath is great. The only thing I routinely use a harder click for, though, is to look up words in the dictionary, although a three-finger tap does that too.

The screen is beautiful. Vibrant, crisp, clear and bright: it’s everything you would expect from a £1,749 computer and is a big part of what makes it good to use. The 13in MacBook Pro is about as beautiful as a regular laptop can be.

Touch Bar

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The emoji button, right next to the send mail button ready to dispatch your latest missive in Mac Mail. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

The biggest visible change is just above the keyboard. The fabled Touch Bar, which replaces the standard function key row with an OLED, touch-sensitive screen. The idea is that it gives you dynamic buttons and sliders to control various aspects of your computing workflow dependent on which app you have open.

By default and without any apps in focus, the Touch Bar displays an escape key and a row of four icons on the right with an arrow expander to show more of the traditional quick settings keys. It’s reminiscent of the Windows task bar.

Holding the Fn key will show the traditional function keys, but can also be set to expand the control keys. Alternatively they can be left expanded like a traditional control row all the time, but that limits what else can be displayed on it.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Calendar entries trigger month and time selectors on the Touch Bar. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

When using a particular program, it’s up to that program which functions are placed on the Touch Bar. Most provide formatting tools such as bold, italics, underline, justify and list tools. There’s the emoji button that does what you may expect in text boxes, plus there’s the same auto-complete suggestions you might get on an iPhone, although stopping typing to tap on them is most definitely slower for anyone who types at a reasonable speed.

Almost all of Apple’s apps have Touch Bar support, and most buttons and functions can be customised. I liked having the send mail button in Mac Mail on the very left, plus a trash rather than archive button. Third-party imaging program Pixelmator is a great example of what can be done with the bar: you can select various tools straight from it, then change the size of them and other aspects. With a bit of practice you can do most things with one hand on the Touch Bar and one on the trackpad.

Those who use the function or control keys a lot will find the Touch Bar slows them down a bit, myself included. Those who touch type will find it more difficult to use as it’s slower to look down at the keyboard and hit a button rather than just bash out a keyboard shortcut. But for those buttons that you would normally mouse over to – in my case the send email button – having it just above the keyboard is faster and more convenient, although not as convenient as a touchscreen.

Touch ID

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The power button in the top right hand corner of the keyboard is now a fingerprint scanner too. Photograph: The Guardian

The power button on the end of the Touch Bar is a Touch ID fingerprint scanner. I found it a bit of a mixed bag. When it works it works just as well as it does on an iPhone 6S, though not as well as on the 7. The problem is that I found it a bit inconsistent. Not knowing when and where you can and can’t use it means its usually faster just to type a password.

Changing a setting, for instance, I normally had to enter my password, but sometimes I could use my fingerprint. When firing up the computer from cold I had to enter my password, but if resuming from standby I could use my fingerprint, unless the battery got too low, or I left it for too long, then it needs my password. You can buy apps with it, and other bits and pieces. Apple Pay works like it does on an iPad, but only in Safari.

You can also only register three fingerprints, which seems like a step backwards from the five you can register on an iPhone.

Fingerprint scanners on a smartphone were such a massive leap forward for usability, I presumed the same would be for laptops, but it wasn’t the case. I certainly don’t lock and unlock a laptop as much as a phone, so maybe my expectations were too high.

The keyboard

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The MacBook Pro logo is now back on the screen’s bezel. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

A lot has been said of Apple’s practically-no-travel keyboards. What you make of them will depend on your typing style. I write a lot, and I type quite lightly. I found there was enough feedback for accurate and fast touch typing, but it made a surprising amount of noise. It’s a different noise to a mechanical keyboard, but it’s definitely in that range, particularly when I was really going for it.

If you give the keys some welly when you type, if you’re used to the travel of a good mechanical keyboard for instance, then you may hate the keyboard. If you’re seriously considering buying one, get down to a shop and try it out for at least five minutes.

General computing power

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Image editing in Pixelmator was a breeze on the machine. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian

The 13in MacBook Pro has a choice of dual-core versions of Intel’s sixth-generation Core i5 or i7 processors. They’re not the latest – that would be the seventh generation – but are entirely capable. The cheapest machine (as tested) has 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM and a 2.9GHz Core i5 processor and is not a power-house by modern standards.

It handled the work I put it through admirably - writing, processing and manipulating photos, creating small snippets of video, gifs and doing the odd bit of number crunching.

With enough tabs open in Chrome, running Evernote, Mac Mail and various other bits and pieces, I did hit the 8GB RAM cap though. As with previous Flash-based Macs, Apple’s use of a speedy page file means you might not notice until you get an occasional sluggish page load or a short delay when jumping between apps. For longevity, 16GB of RAM is worth buying for most people, given it’s soldered on and you can’t change it later.

For the general consumer, the 13in MacBook Pro is more than capable of getting the job done, but given it has “Pro” in the name, perhaps that isn’t enough. Attempting to edit small documentary-length 4K video is likely to a bit of a chore on it, particularly if you do not use Apple’s video editing suite, but then I’m not sure many who buy a 13in laptop are likely to be attempting to do so.

It’s worth noting that the massive jumps in processing performance every 12 months or so that was possible five to 10 years ago have more or less faded into distant memory, replaced instead by incremental gains and reduced power consumption in computers.

Where are all the ports?

Apple has decided that USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 are the future, which means apart from a headphones/mic socket, all you get are four USB-C ports. There’s no card reader, no traditional USB, no ethernet or mini DisplayPort. USB-C is even used for power, which means any of the four ports can be used to charge the MacBook Pro.

It might be the future, but right now it’s a dongle-ridden faff. How much it’s a problem depends on what you normally plug into your machine. Many things are cable agnostic – just buy a USB-C to USB-A cable to connect your printer, if you still have one.

But many are not and the lack of even just one USB-A port is irritating. I ended up carrying an extra six different cables and adapters just to continue as I was, adding another step to most peripheral action.

The funny thing is that many Android smartphones ship with USB-C to USB-C cables, meaning they can be plugged straight into the MacBook Pro no problem, but Apple’s own iPhone requires either a dongle or USB-C to Lightning cable to be bought.

Five-to-six hour battery

Lack of ports is something you can get used to. Lack of battery life is not.

Apple claims that the 13in MacBook Pro will last for 10 hours under its testing conditions. I didn’t get anywhere close to that figure. Barely using it for more than emailing and browsing with a few tabs open in Chrome, the brightness set at about 75%, Evernote and Twitter open and Double Shot preventing it from sleeping, I managed just over six hours on battery. Swapping Chrome out for Safari increased battery life for some sites, but I noticed others really chewed through battery, meaning it came out about even.

A good working day with about 10 tabs open in Chrome, as well as Typora for text, Wire for chat, Mac Mail for email, Twitter and Pixelmator open intermittently for image editing when required, I got just over five hours. I’m not sure that could be counted as really pushing the machine either.

If it was the 15in MacBook Pro I could almost imagine that you’d never use it when away from power, and that battery life wasn’t that important. But a 13in laptop is made for portability. Thankfully charging it from dead while under full working conditions only took one hour 40 minutes, and less if I wasn’t actively using it.

Observations

I wish you could permanently place a single F key on the Touch Bar, but you can’t

Touch ID seems slower than on an iPhone 7

Below 5% battery the computer becomes incredibly sluggish

Being able to plug in power either side is great

The speakers are louder and sound better than old MacBook Pros, but still not quite room filling

The USB-C ports are too close together to put anything wider into them meaning USB-C to USB-A adapters have to have a decent cord length to attach them next to anything else

I kept touching the Touch Bar accidentally when resting my hands on the keyboard

Changing the volume or brightness is now a two-stage tap and tap or tap and drag affair

Price

The 13in MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts at £1,749 and reaches £2,759 with optional upgrades.

For comparison, Dell’s XPS 13 with a compatible screen starts at £1,129, Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 with an Intel Core i5 starts at £849 and the Surface Book starts at £1,299.

Verdict

The 13in MacBook Pro could be a wonderful computer, but it isn’t. Is it great to use? Absolutely, it’s brilliant, it’s beautiful, it’s almost everything Apple said it was, I absolutely love it … until it runs out of battery. Or you have to dig out yet another dongle to use a sodding USB flash drive, or a card reader, or attach a display. Or you realise that you spent a month’s mortgage money on a computer and are having your house repossessed.

And that is the 13in MacBook Pro’s biggest flaw. It is very expensive for what it is. It hasn’t got the latest processors or graphics, it has limits on the amount of RAM you can pay to shove in it and you can’t change anything after you’ve bought it. That’s not such a problem for a general computer, but a minimum of £1,749 for a general computer, even a post-Brexit referendum Apple computer, is a lot of money.

So then it’s “for the Pros”, who justify spending large sums of money on working machines. But it’s not capable of getting through a journalist’s day on battery, let alone anyone who does anything more intensive than browse the internet, write in a basic text editor and edit the odd photo. It’ll saddle you with iPhone 7 syndrome – constantly in search of a power supply or chaining you to using it as a small desktop surrogate.

Perhaps all-day battery life shouldn’t be a thing we expect, but previous Apple computers could do just that and more.

And there’s the question of power. For almost two grand you’d expect a machine to last four to five years. For a demanding user who must have a “Pro” the RAM cap of 16GB isn’t going to cut it in two years time, which again, wouldn’t be a problem if the machine cost £1,000 not £2,000.

So, then, the 13in MacBook Pro is the best computer you shouldn’t buy.

Pros: beautiful, great screen, interesting Touch Bar, Touch ID, massive trackpad, thin and relatively light, USB-C Cons: short battery life, no USB-A ports, no ethernet, no native display ports, no upgrading after purchase, very expensive

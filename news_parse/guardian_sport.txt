Judy Murray says fellow spectator who ripped towel from grip of young fan ‘should be ashamed’ as US player vows to replace it

An US tennis player who tried to throw his towel to a young fan in the crowd only to spark an ugly tussle has launched a search for the intended recipient.

Jack Sock, the world No 18, threw his towel into the crowd after the unidentified boy gestured for it, but the souvenir was tugged from his hands by a man wearing a white hat, who was sitting in front.

Andy Murray’s outraged mother, Judy, tweeted:



judy murray (@JudyMurray) If ur the bloke in the blue polo shirt and hat, you should be ashamed...... https://t.co/KlZ250NCQP

Sock, who beat Christian Garin on court 8 on Tuesday, tweeted:



Jack Sock (@JackSock) If anyone knows the kid that unfortunately had the towel ripped out of his hands...tweet his name at me and I'll be sure to get him one 🤙🏻

His appeal led to an immediate response from the US Open – “If you find out, we’d like to send him a US Open towel” – and the suggestion for the Australian Open and Roland Garros accounts to do the same “for a Slam sweep”.



The Australian Open replied straight away: “No sweat! Happy to chip in an AusOpen towel.”



The official towel maker for Wimbledon, Christy, has also offered him one if he can be traced.

Judy Murray said tennis souvenirs were an important part of encouraging enthusiasm and interest in the sport. “I know what it’s like for children and young people at Wimbledon and you know, I think the kid had caught it and the other guy just pulled it away from him, and I thought: ‘What are you doing?’

“I hope that somebody recognises him and comes forward with his name and that Jack Sock can give him a towel, and it was lovely to see Jack Sock offering to do that.”



She added: “You want the whole thing to be a wonderful experience and you don’t want anybody to be going home disappointed, so I think it was a lovely gesture from him and I hope he manages to find the guy.”



She recalled that Andy’s childhood wish was to get the autograph of his “absolute hero” Andre Agassi. “He would like literally be out there at the practice courts all day hoping to get the autograph, and he actually never managed to do it, and it had quite a big impact on him as a little kid.

“I think that is one of the reasons why he’s so good at staying behind and signing everything for everybody because of the experience.”

• Murray reveals he has been managing a hip problem for at least seven years • World No97 Dustin Brown is next-up in Wimbledon second round

If Andy Murray reaches the final of the 131st Wimbledon, he will surely be as sore and spent as on any of the previous three occasions he has contested the title, because no amount of upbeat chat can disguise either the discomfort of his aching hip or the magnitude of the unknown challenge ahead of him.

Murray insists all is well with an injury that is not only at least seven years old but last week hurt so much he knew he could not defend his title unless he gave it complete rest. That is more than a minor niggle.

Andy Murray’s ability to overcome adversity faces ultimate Wimbledon test Read more

To his credit, he came through the first examination of his resolve with a quick and convincing win over the world No135 Alexander Bublik in the first round on Monday and now prepares for an altogether different contest against his friend Dustin Brown on Wednesday.

“It is something I have been dealing with since I was 22 or 23 years old, off and on,” he said before heading for yet another ice bath. “It is sore, but I get through it. It is not like a horrific injury in my knee. In time, it is something I need to look after.

“After the [French Open semi-final] match with Stan Wawrinka, I thought I was just a bit sore because it was such a long, tough match and I had not played many of those over the last couple of months. But then it did not really get better.

“I was practising a lot on grass and preparing for Queen’s and my hip was getting gradually worse. Then I said: ‘I need to stop now because this is actually affecting the way I am playing and affecting my practices.’ I knew if I had to go on court like that I could not serve and hobble around and get through matches. I needed to get ready to play and that meant taking a break.”

Logic – or what passes for it in modern tennis – suggests Murray should beat Brown handily when the world No1 plays the man ranked 97th. Yet the application of reason has turned nearly every expert into the tennis equivalent of Michael Fish lately. At Roland Garros, Murray beat the odds to reach the semi-finals for the fourth time despite looking drained to the point of collapse at the start of the fortnight; here, he retrieved much of his credibility against Bublik after losing to the world No90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queen’s.

If that theory needed supporting, evidence arrived on Court No2 on Tuesday when world No486 Thanasi Kokkinakis saved six match points before losing to the 2009 US champion Juan Martín del Potro in four tight sets over three hours. This is a desperately difficult tournament in which to pick winners with the certainty of old.

Murray acknowledges Brown’s threat, even though he took only eight games off the Scot in the second round of the 2010 US Open. Brown, a well-travelled pro who has added discipline to his widely recognised gifts, will probably do better here on grass than the hardcourt of Flushing Meadows when his career was still meandering a little. He beat Rafael Nadal in four sets in the second round here two years ago, although the Spaniard had compiled a woeful record at the All England Club since winning his two titles.

Johanna Konta, the host country’s best hope in the women’s draw, looked back to her impressive best beating her French Open nemesis Hsieh Su-wei in just over an hour on Monday; on Wednesday she plays another recent conqueror in Donna Vekic, but brings greater momentum this time.

The 21-year-old Croatian, who got the better of Konta last month, conceded: “She is definitely the favourite. It doesn’t matter that I beat her in Nottingham, it was different circumstances. I played very well in Nottingham, I had a very good rhythm and my game was going less up and down than usual.

“Maybe I will have a chance in that she will feel more pressure than me, especially on Centre Court. I don’t have much to lose. If I serve well I will have a chance and if I want to beat her I must play my best tennis.”

Mark Cavendish has withdrawn from the Tour de France after he suffered a fractured shoulder blade in a horrendous crash 200 metres from the finish line on stage four. Cycling’s governing body quickly disqualified the world champion, Peter Sagan, for a dangerous move in the sprint finish in which he appeared to elbow the British rider to the floor.

Cavendish also sustained a heavy cut to his hand and was taken to hospital for x-rays to investigate injuries to the shoulder he damaged in a similar pile-up at the end of the first stage of the Tour in Harrogate in July 2014. In a chaotic finale, the yellow jersey holder, Geraint Thomas, also fell – but to no ill effect.

On Tuesday night it was confirmed that Cavendish’s Tour is over. “I’m obviously massively disappointed to get this news about the fracture,” he said. “I feel I was in a good position to win [the stage] and to lose that and even having to leave the Tour, a race I have built my whole career around, is really sad.”

Cavendish’s sporting director at Dimension Data, Roger Hammond, described the move that led to Sagan’s expulsion as “a flick of the elbow which was completely outrageous”. He added: “No one comes out of it well. This is a sad, sad day for the sport, Sagan is a hero and an idol of mine but a precedent has to be set.”

Sagan was initially relegated to 115th place on the stage – last place in the lead bunch – and received the standard sanction of a 30-second time penalty but the president of the jury, Philippe Marien, said the referees applied a sterner sanction because the world champion “had put several other riders involved in the crash in danger”.

Sagan’s Bora-Hansgrohe team announced they had officially protested about the Slovak’s expulsion. The German team said Sagan “rejected [the claim] to have caused, or in any way intended to cause, the crash of Mark Cavendish”. On Wednesday morning, Sagan appeared to have accepted his fate.

“I can accept the decision but for sure I do not agree with them, because I think I have done nothing wrong,” Sagan said in a statement delivered outside the team hotel.

“It is very bad that Mark fell down, it is important he can recover well, I am sorry for that,” he added. “As you saw it was a crazy sprint, it was not the first one like that or the last one. I wish that Mark recovers well.”

In two crashes in the final kilometres involving about 20 riders, it was Cavendish who came off worst, being the first of three sprinters to hit the deck. He lay prone on the tarmac as the rest of the group passed and crossed the line several minutes after the stage winner, Arnaud Démare. Cavendish was holding his right shoulder, with his skin suit ripped from shoulder to waist, and with heavy bandaging on his right hand.

“I’m going to go and get it checked out,” he said. “I will definitely need stitches in this finger, it’s bleeding a lot. With the shoulder, it might be something to do with a previous injury, it’s sat backwards, so I’m not sure if I’ve done something to the ligament. I’m not a doctor but from the feelings, I’m not optimistic.”

The Guardian understands he hit the road so hard he folded the spider and the chainring of his chainset so that they were pointing backwards. Sagan was one of several riders, including Cavendish, who launched their sprints in the wake of the Norwegian Alexandr Kristoff and were accelerating to full speed with around 250m to go. Cavendish was following Démare through a gap between Sagan and the crowd barriers when the Slovak moved to his right, making contact with the Manxman.

Sagan then lifted his elbow up and Cavendish was forced into the barriers in a split second and fell heavily on his right side. “There was no reason for that elbow,” said Hammond. “As a former professional bike rider I know the way it is done.” The German John Degenkolb, who was close behind, rode over Cavendish’s body and helmet and also fell, while the Briton Ben Swift performed a somersault over Cavendish’s bike as it lay on the ground but later told the Guardian he had no injuries.

“I get on with Peter well; if he came across that’s one thing but I’m not a fan of him putting his elbow in me like that,” Cavendish said. “A crash is a crash but I would just like to know about the elbow. I have a good relationship with Peter but I would like to speak to him about it.”

The world champion apologised to Cavendish afterwards but offered no real explanation. “I didn’t know Mark was behind me, he was coming from the right side and I wanted to take the wheel of Kristoff, I think. I wanted to go on his wheel but Mark was coming pretty fast from the back. I didn’t have time to react to go left, he just came to me and then to the barriers.”

Sagan added: “When I was told after the finish that Mark had crashed, I went straight away to find out how he was doing. We are friends and colleagues in the peloton and crashes like that are never nice. I hope Mark recovers soon.”

Philippe Marien, the head UCI commissaire [race official], said: “Before the Tour de France we warned the sprinters that we would look very closely at every sprint, that is what we did today. It was not an easy decision, but this is the beginning of the Tour and now is the moment to set our boundaries. And that is what we did today. It was not about Sagan, but about the act the rider made. What happens here, it looks like it was on purpose and it almost looks like hitting a person. It’s not about Cavendish and Sagan, it could be anybody, the names won’t matter.”

Better known as a sedate spa town and a still mineral water, Vittel does things when the Tour comes to visit. In 1968 this was the start town for a Tour de Santé, supposedly to relaunch the sport in the wake of Tom Simpson’s death, but which ended in two positive drug tests over the three weeks.

On Tuesday, what should have been a decorous celebration of 10 years in which Vittel has been the ‘eaufficiel’ du Tour, ended in Sagan’s disqualification.

This was a massive event, partly because of Sagan’s profile as the most popular rider in cycling, but also because this was the first time a world champion had been thrown off the race since Laurent Brochard was given his marching orders during the Festina drug scandal of 1998. And it is rare indeed for the race’s referees to decide that any of the plethora of dodgy manoeuvres and dirty tricks that happen in sprints is sufficiently life-threatening to merit expulsion.

The last time such a thing happened was in 2010 when the mild-mannered Australian Mark Renshaw decided to use his head as well as his legs at Bourg les Valence, not once, but several times, while in 1997 the otherwise utterly genteel Belgian Tom Steels was sent home for bunging a bidon at a fellow fast man.

The problem boils down to this: sprinters are usually as pleasant as they come, but the scent of the line causes a red mist to descend. This is part of their makeup, but just occasionally there is an attempt to draw a line. Unfortunately the fast men will be butting up against that line – if that is not an unfortunate choice of words – soon, probably as early as Thursday.

Sagan’s expulsion left the race for the green jersey wide open, and the favourite now will be the Frenchman Demare, who emerged from the chaos here to give France its first bunch sprint stage winner since Jimmy Casper. Demare is the national champion and rides for the national favourite Francaise des Jeux, whose patriotic manager Marc Madiot refuses to sully the tricolour by letting it be daubed with his sponsors’ logos.

France will delight in Demare’s win, which reflected well on his turn of speed and it will follow his quest for the green jersey with bated breath in the next 17 days. If there was a slight false note, it came when he was accused of misbehaviour by fourth-placed Nacer Bouhanni, who alleged he had cut him up in the finale. Then again, nor is Bouhanni a stranger to the referees’ communiques. Where sprinting is concerned, earning the right to throw the first metaphorical stone is a big ask.

On Wednesday, the race gets serious with the finish at La Planche des Belles Filles ski resort in the Vosges mountains north of Belfort. The Tour has finished here twice, in 2012 and 2014, and on each occasion the race leader at the summit – in 2012 Bradley Wiggins, in 2014 Vincenzo Nibali – has worn yellow all the way to Paris, and perhaps more importantly that the finishing order at the summit strongly reflects the eventual standings at the end of the Tour.

In both years, seven of the first 10 finishers on top of the 20% wall that concludes the six-kilometre climb also finished in the first 10 in Paris. The chances are that either Geraint Thomas or his leader Chris Froome will retain the lead for Team Sky, although the Welshman hinted that Team Sky may give free rein to a long-distance escape. In Vittel, Thomas fell in a 15-man pile-up in the final kilometre, while Froome was held up, but did not fall.

That would happen if there are no riders up front who are a threat to Froome in the overall standings, as relinquishing the lead to another team will relieve them of the need to expend energy in defence of the maillot jaune. “I don’t think we will waste a lot of energy to bring back a big break if there is no one dangerous in it, and if it goes to someone who is not a threat overall, it’s not a big deal. If we are all together on the climb Froome is our main goal, so I will do what I can to help him. If he gets the jersey, great, if I keep it, that’s even better.”

~~

The short but nasty climb at the finish of Wednesday’s fifth stage has pedigree when it comes to deciding who will wear the yellow jersey in Paris

In the past, it used to be said that whoever led the Tour de France at L’Alpe d’Huez would win overall. In recent years, something similar could be stated of the Alsatian climb to La Planche des Belles Filles, nicknamed “Le Petit Alpe d’Huez” by cyclists who struggle up there each year in the Trois Ballons sportive, and climbed by the Tour at the finish of Wednesday’s fifth stage.

The Tour has visited “the Plank” twice, in 2012 and 2014, and the rider in the yellow jersey that day – Sir Bradley Wiggins and Vincenzo Nibali – has gone on to take the Tour. As well as providing a springboard for Wiggins’s win, the finish also ended in a moment that is significant with hindsight: Chris Froome’s first stage victory in the Tour.

This year, as in those two other Tours, it will be the first occasion when the race favourites have to unveil their A-game. “It’s going to be the first GC [general classification] battle, the first real test for us GC guys to see where we are at,” said Froome. In the inevitable French jargon, it is le premier juge de paix.

The time gaps opened up on its slopes are usually measured in seconds, but the sheer toughness of the Plank, its steepness and the lack of any respite, means that it offers a condensed verdict on the strength of each contender for the overall standings.

The climb goes to a relatively low altitude, just over 1,000m, and is not long, at 5.9km. It is, however, longer than it once was. Before the Tour’s first visit in 2012, there was controversy when the work to accommodate the race included an extension of the road up the climb to include a final kilometre at a gradient of 20%, prompting protests from environmentalists who felt that the normal development rules had been waived in favour of the Tour.

Vincenzo Nibali regains yellow jersey as Alberto Contador crashes out Read more

It is this final push to a single building on a large car park in the middle of upland meadows that makes the climb so difficult, coming as it does after an opening phase that must feel like hitting the side of a house, with an initial gradient of about one in six.

What is different this year is what precedes the climb. Five years ago, it was tackled after two third-category ascents, and, as this year, it came relatively early, seven stages into the race. In 2014, it was preceded by six ascents including three first-category climbs, with the final one – the short, steep, hair-pinned Col des Chevrères – coming in the final 30km. That was termed the toughest medium-mountain stage in Tour history by the organisers and it came after two days heavy-duty climbing in the mountains of eastern France.

On the day, heavy rain and thick fog turned the stage into a slog, marked mainly by the severe crash by Alberto Contador that put the double Tour-winner out of the race. Froome, it should be noted, did not make it to the Vosges, having fallen off and broken his wrist on the stage over the cobbles a couple of days earlier.

This year, the run-in is relatively straightforward, with only one third-category ascent that is unlikely to split the field to any extent. There is a strong chance that a substantial group will hit the foot of the climb together and burst asunder like a wave hitting a cliff face.

Before the final run-in eastwards to the start of the climb at Plancher-les-Mines, the race goes within a couple of kilometres of Mélisey, home town of Thibaut Pinot, whose father is mayor there. Pinot will, therefore, be the “regional” of the stage, with all the pressure that entails. In reality, however, the heat will be on all the contenders, who know that they need to show their hands here.

Nowhere near as long as L’Alpe d’Huez, nowhere near as spectacular as Mont Ventoux or the Galibier, the Plank will never have the legendary status of those ascents or the Puy de Dôme, the extinct volcano in the Massif Central that hosted the French equivalent of the Stanley Matthews Cup final, the Anquetil-Poulidor duel of 1964.

The Plank’s relative brevity and its steepness does not make for a drawn-out mano a mano of that kind, but its geographical location suggests something else. Given the penchant of the organiser, Christian Prudhomme, for hilltop finishes on the final Saturday, there has to be a good chance that the near future will see the Tour climb the Plank for a final showdown before the last transfer to Paris.

South Africa’s fast bowling duo have nine wickets from two matches, while the leg-spin of captain Dane van Niekerk yielded four for no runs against West Indies

Into the business end we go. After two wins from three, England Women face the first of their final four group stage matches that can set up their route to World Cup success. It could just as easily send them careering off the road.

Sarah Taylor finds her form as England ease to win over Sri Lanka Read more

They have yet to play the defending champions, Australia, who they meet here on Sunday, and a strong New Zealand side who will be their opponents at Derby next Wednesday. An underwhelming, unpredictable West Indies – winless from their three matches so far – would love an upset to finish their disappointing campaign on Saturday week.

On Wednesday in Bristol, England face one of the world’s most improved sides in South Africa. Through a combination of greater focus and increased funding, starting in October 2013 with the awarding of central contracts to six players, the Proteas have built a skills-rich and culturally diverse squad.

At the helm is Dane van Niekerk, their 24-year-old captain and one of two leg-spinning all-rounders, whose straight-talking is refreshing. A case in point, her words after taking four wickets for zero runs in their previous match to dismiss West Indies for just 48 on Sunday: “Not to sound naive, but the ball’s not coming out great. I don’t know what happened. I can’t tell you what happened. I bowled so many full tosses in the nets.”

It is in their fast bowling reserves that South Africa pack the biggest punch with Marizanne Kapp and Shabnim Ismail – two genuine quicks who are the perfect buddy-cop blend of “by-the-book” and untameable maverick; role model and cult hero respectively.

Kapp is an all-rounder by choice and the No1-ranked ODI bowler by feat – a traditional outswing bowler who excels wherever she is in the world, consistently impressing in the Big Bash League. Ice in her veins, heat from her hands.

Ismail, by contrast, is fuelled by fire. She rates herself as the quickest bowler going and has been clocked at 79mph. Her inspiration growing up was André Nel and it shows beyond adopting his number on her back (89). While Nel would summon the fury of his in-game persona “Gunther” to get himself going, Ismail has found it hard to leave her own Gunther on the field. In July 2014, she was suspended by Cricket South Africa for alcohol abuse. She does not do things by halves.

Together, they have combined for nine wickets in two matches (their game against New Zealand was rained off). By contrast, England’s pace duo of Katherine Brunt and Anya Shrubsole, both carrying injuries, have only two from three between them. “I’ve got the best opening pair in the world,” said Van Niekerk in the pre-match press conference. “I’ll put my head on the block for that one.”

England are wary of the challenge ahead of them. Mark Robinson’s first tour as head coach was away to South Africa at the start of 2016, winning 2-1 in both the ODIs and T20s. The players, too, know exactly what to expect: women’s cricket is a small world and both Kapp (Surrey Stars) and Ismail (Yorkshire Diamonds) have played in the Kia Super League.

After preparing against spin for the challenges of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, pace bowlers have been brought in for training – a mixture of local men’s league bowlers and a number of England academy players, including left-armer Tash Farrant who missed out on making the World Cup squad.

England’s captain, Heather Knight, remains confident her batting lineup can combat what will be sent down from Kapp, Ismail and anybody else. Robinson was especially punchy. “We love pace,” he said. “England players are brought up on pace. A lot of our players got brought up playing club cricket against men, so they naturally want pace on the ball.”

Hampshire have not forgotten about the two days last July when, at a sweltering Ageas Bowl, Surrey posted 637 for seven declared to set up a dramatic win. It was, for Hampshire’s attack, filthy toil and, as one Surrey player admitted, they had continued batting after tea on the second day “just to piss them off”.

Since then, however, Hampshire have done a decent deal in retribution. At The Oval last August three centurions saw them to 582 and here they posted their fifth highest score: 648 for seven declared, spread painstakingly across more than 161 overs, with George Bailey joining Jimmy Adams and James Vince as centurions.

Bailey’s was wonderfully Australian: death by a thousand cuts, relentlessly hammering home the advantage for 161 runs across almost six hours, without ever really needing to accelerate. Eventually he was well caught at long-on off Scott Borthwick, who he had reverse-swept plenty but had been worthy of a wicket.

Hampshire’s pain train stopped at every Surrey station. Bailey and Sean Ervine shared a record fifth-wicket stand. Ian Holland made his maiden half-century. Gareth Berg hit Dom Sibley for three sixes in his 16-ball 35, then was caught at long-on going for a fourth. With that came the declaration, and tea. Along the way there had been a Jason Roy side injury (he should be fine to bat) while two of Surrey’s three teen bowlers, Amar Virdi and Conor McKerr, brought up unwelcome centuries as they ticked along at over four an over.

And so, with Bailey’s declaration the game began in earnest. Mark Stoneman’s snub has left the Surrey man wondering what he has to do for an England call, and in Saturday’s Cup final loss and here he has batted like a man scorned. His driving, through cover particularly but down the ground too, was immaculate and he also cut neatly behind point. Having weathered better bowling, Ervine appeared and Stoneman seemed slightly bemused to turn him to slip.

He had shared 103 with Rory Burns, who looked in fine order, especially having directed traffic for so long in only his second game as captain. He made both his centuries last season against Hampshire and is desperate for a score; with the follow-on target still 446 away, now would be a grand time for it.

Stevie Eskinazi’s brilliant, unbeaten 178 provided Middlesex with a strong day against Warwickshire. They took less than 10 overs to pick up the final three Warwickshire wickets (they made 334) and, having lost Sam Robson third ball to Keith Barker, they closed on 302 for six. Eskinazi made 114 in boundaries, but no other batsman has reached 40.

Only 44 overs were possible at Scarborough where Craig Overton took his second five-wicket haul of the season as Yorkshire struggled to 159 for seven, 109 behind Somerset.

Kent’s Sean Dickson scored the first Championship triple century since Kevin Pietersen in May 2015 as runs flowed at Beckenham. Dickson, who had four ducks and a seven in his five most recent first innings, hit his county’s second triple, and first since 1935, and was involved in their highest partnership for any wicket, 382 with Joe Denly (182) for the second. Having conceded their highest total and requiring 552 to avoid the follow-on, Northants closed on 180 for one after losing Rob Newton to Yasir Shah, and with Ben Duckett on 101.

After the drama of a 25-wicket opening day, only five more fell at Cheltenham (suggesting the issues were not subterraneous but the fault of batsmen) and that proved enough to force a result, with Gloucestershire beating Glamorgan by 10 wickets. Liam Norwell took six for 38 as Glamorgan were bowled out for 158, before Cameron Bancroft (62) and Chris Dent (68) – the first two scores of more than 40 in the match – knocked off the required 135 with ease for a remarkable two-day win.

Imran Tahir took five wickets on his Derbyshire debut (this is a record-equalling sixth county for the South Africa spinner) as Durham closed 94 behind at Chesterfield. Derbyshire’s 10th wicket was worth 102 as they posted 368 in their first innings, with Billy Godleman last man out for 98. That Durham are as close as they are is thanks in large part to an unbroken stand of 69 between Paul Coughlin (62) and Barry McCarthy (32) for the ninth wicket. Hamidullah Qadri, who at 16 received his first call-up from England under-19s, accounted for the opener Michael Richardson, who made 64.

The British Horseracing Authority has confirmed that, as disclosed in The Guardian late on Tuesday night, the trainer Alan King will face a disciplinary hearing on Thursday over a failed dope test on Yanworth, the beaten favourite in the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham in March.

The BHA also revealed that the substance found in Yanworth’s system after he finished seventh at the Festival was triamcinolone acetonide (TCA), a synthetic corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It can be legitimately used as a treatment on horses in training but must have cleared their system by the day of a race.

Yanworth failed a dope test after finishing unplaced in Champion Hurdle Read more

King was fined £1,000 last year after another of his horses, Midnight Cataria, tested positive for TCA having been administered with the drug by King’s vet. The hearing into the case was told that the substance would have been expected to clear the horse’s system in 21 days but had in fact persisted for 52.

The panel for Thursday’s hearing, which will hear the case in King’s absence, is the first to be convened since the introduction of a new pool of 23 potential members and chairs of disciplinary hearings. Tim Charlton QC, a veteran of disciplinary proceedings in the past, will chair the three-strong panel, alongside two new recruits to the system: Dr Lyn Griffiths, a former racecourse medical officer, and the journalist and blogger Simon Rowlands, who is also the chairman of the Horseracing Bettors Forum.

Pumblechook (7.40), a 10-1 chance at Kempton Park in Wednesday evening, deserves close consideration by punters looking for a bet on the five British cards for the day.

Roger Varian’s four-year-old Gibbs Hill heads the market here at around 7-4, having finished third in a strong race at York in May, and has winning form on an artificial surface, too. His best form, though, is on turf with a little cut in the ground and Wednesday’s contest is a competitive event, with more depth than the market may suggest.

It is possible to pick a hole in the bare form of Pumblechook’s latest 10-length success at Newmarket as his main market rival was well below form. The time of the race, though, was excellent and another step forward after a win at Leicester earlier in June. With the market focusing on a couple of his rivals, his chance of completing a hat-trick may have been underestimated.

Elsewhere on the day’s cards, Fink Hill (2.00) should take the opener at Thirsk and become the fourth horse from his debut race behind the subsequent Coventry Stakes winner Rajasinghe to record a success next time up. Wentworth Falls (3.30) is a worthy favourite on the same card, while I’vegothepower (7.30) is the value in the feature event at Bath.

Barkis (4.10) and Prettylittlething (2.50) are the picks over jumps at Perth and Worcester respectively, while the Group 3 event for fillies at Fairyhouse could also be a race of note, as victory for one of Aidan O’Brien’s two runners, Asking and Music Box, would complete a set for the trainer of at least one win in every one of Ireland’s 69 Group races.

Yanworth failed a post-race dope test after running in the Champion Hurdle at this year’s Cheltenham Festival and his trainer, Alan King, is facing the likelihood of disciplinary action. A hearing has been organised for Thursday by the British Horseracing Authority, though the sport’s ruling body was careful last night not to offer details about the charges King faces.

It is not yet known what the banned substance found in Yanworth’s system was. However, the fact that he failed a test was confirmed by a source last night. No comment was offered by either the horse’s owner, JP McManus, or by King who, under racing’s rules, must bear responsibility for any such finding.

The Champion Hurdle was the only race in which Yanworth was beaten during the last jumps season. He went to Cheltenham in March as the winner of his previous three races, started as the 2-1 favourite but finished only seventh, 14 lengths behind the Nicky Henderson-trained Buveur D’Air, who also carried McManus’s colours.

Yanworth reappeared at Aintree’s Grand National meeting in April and returned to winning ways, landing his second Grade One of the season. However, he did so at the much longer distance of three miles and the generally accepted view is he lacked the pace to be competitive in the two-mile Champion Hurdle. Having won a Grade One race at a major Festival, Yanworth must also have been dope-tested after his Aintree success and it is believed he tested clear on that occasion.

King faced a similar disciplinary hearing last year after his Midnight Cataria tested positive for the anti-inflammatory Triamcinolone Acetonide (TCA) the previous autumn, having run second in a handicap chase at Kempton. Racehorses may be treated with TCA so long as it has cleared their system by the day of any race in which they take part. It was agreed between the BHA and King that the source of the banned substance was an injection by King’s vet, who had been treating the horse for lameness. TCA should, according to the vet, have cleared the horse’s system in 21 days but in fact endured for 52 days.

The BHA disqualified Midnight Cataria and fined King £1,000. It is believed the trainer is now at risk of a comparable punishment for Yanworth’s case unless he can provide evidence that exonerates him.

TCA was also the drug involved in the case of Any Currency, a winner at the Cheltenham Festival in 2016 who was subsequently disqualified after failing a dope test. On that occasion the BHA’s disciplinary panel opted not to impose a fine on the trainer Martin Keighley, ruling that, in allowing 41 days for the drug to clear his horse’s system before the raceday, he had “taken all reasonable measures” and that it was “exceptional” for TCA to still be in the horse’s system such a long time after injection.

Keighley claimed that amounted to an official view that the team around Any Currency had done nothing wrong. “The treatment we put in was fine, we have just been unlucky,” he said at the time. “It is frustrating for everyone involved that we have lost the race, but we just need to move on.”

Yanworth’s case is not thought to be of the same gravity as the case of Anseanachai Cliste, in the news this week as the BHA ponders what charges to offer against his Armagh-based trainer, Stephen McConville. The horse was ordered to be withdrawn from the Foxhunters Chase by the Cheltenham Festival stewards because they could not be satisfied he had received only normal food and water that day.

Anseanachai Cliste went on to win the Ulster National nine days later, testing negative for any banned substance immediately after that race. There has been speculation that the BHA might still take another month or more before deciding how to handle the case.

February did not end well for JP McManus, as an American court rejected his claim for a refund of $5.2m in tax paid on his winnings of $17.4m in a three-day backgammon match in California in 2012. A different game of chance brought a welcome change of fortune here on Tuesday as Buveur D’Air and My Tent Of Yours completed a one-two for McManus’s famous green and gold colours in the Champion Hurdle, and made him the first owner in Festival history to reach 50 winners at the meeting.

This was a notable victory too for Nicky Henderson, the trainer of both horses, who took sole ownership of the record for Champion Hurdle victories with his sixth success in the race. There is also the added satisfaction for the trainer that Buveur D’Air started his season in novice chases and switched back to the smaller obstacles thanks to Henderson’s hunch that Buveur D’Air still had the speed and quality to win a Champion Hurdle.

Petit Mouchoir, the winner of the Irish Champion Hurdle in February, started the race in his familiar front-running role but was less than fluent at a couple of flights and was clearly not going as well as several opponents with half a mile to run.

Brain Power, Henderson’s third runner, was one of those travelling easily in behind, only to drop away rapidly coming down the hill. Henderson’s sixth Champion Hurdle success was assured some way from home. Buveur D’Air took the measure of Petit Mouchoir going to the last and it was soon clear only his stable companion stood any chance of reeling him in.

My Tent Or Yours is one of life’s runner’s up at this meeting. As Buveur D’Air stayed on strongly for Noel Fehily, My Tent Or Yours kept on to finish second for the third time in the Champion Hurdle and fourth time in all at the Festival.

“It doesn’t get much better than that,” McManus said. “I can’t remember what Nicky said [when he wanted to return Buveur D’Air to hurdles] but he said it more than once. He was pretty insistent and in the end we let him have his way. He was sure he wanted to give him a shot even before Faugheen and Annie Power [the last two winners of the race] were declared non-runners. He’s a top man and sometimes you have to go along with it.”

Henderson made his name here as the trainer of See You Then, a three-times winner of the Champion Hurdle in the mid-1980s, and remains the most successful trainer in the meeting’s history. This win took his Festival total to 57, and completed a double on the day after Altior’s win in the Arkle Trophy.

“The horse that Buveur D’Air beat very easily first time out over fences at Haydock [Cloudy Dream] was second to Altior in the Arkle,” Henderson said, “and I thought, blimey, that’s good chasing form. I wondered if I had got it wrong.

“But we felt it was the right thing to do and it has worked on the day. On paper it wasn’t a historic Champion Hurdle but it was very open and there to be taken. I’m sure horses don’t understand sympathy but we’re hugely proud of My Tent Or Yours coming back to finish second again. He’s been a legend but we’ve beaten him ourselves and Buveur D’Air was great.

“I remember coming up to Barry Geraghty on Trials Day here in January and saying: ‘Look, I just know we’re going down the wrong road with Buveur D’Air for the time being. There’s unfinished business.’”

McManus also suggested that Yanworth, the well-beaten 2-1 favourite, would have been his personal pick from his three-strong team for the race and it is difficult to be sure which of them would have been ridden by Geraghty, McManus’s retained jockey, had he not been ruled out of the meeting by injury.

Fehily would have been an obvious choice for Buveur D’Air had Geraghty opted for Yanworth, however, having steered him to a Grade One success at Aintree last season, and he rode a cool race on the 5-1 chance on the way to his second Champion Hurdle success.

“I thought early on that he was doing too much, that maybe I’d taken too long to get him switched off, but once I got to the top of the hill I was very happy,” Fehily said. “He travelled great down the hill and that was the one part of the race I was worried about.”

Buveur D’Air will need to step up to senior company if he goes back over fences next year, having lost his novice status with his defeat of Cloudy Dream at Haydock, but his success here means he is likely to spend at least one more season over timber.

“It will be difficult not to stay over hurdles,” Henderson said. “He’s a novice for the rest of this season so he could go to Aintree next month for a novice chase but that would be a bit bizarre.

“If Aintree was soft, then the two-and-a-half mile hurdle there might be perfect for him.”

Buveur D’Air is the early 6-1 favourite for next season’s Champion Hurdle, with Faugheen, the winner in 2015, next in the list at 10-1.

Former captain Michael Clarke has proposed a simple short-term solution to Australian cricket’s pay dispute, urging the warring parties to extend the previous agreement for 12 months.

Some 230 cricketers became unemployed when the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) expired last week and there remains no sign of progress in the heated spat between Cricket Australia (CA) and the Australian Cricketers’ Association (ACA), who remain deadlocked over the issue of revenue sharing.

This month’s Australia A tour will almost certainly be scrapped, while there are fears this summer’s Ashes could be affected by the impasse.

Clarke, speaking to reporters at the Nine Network’s marketing launch for the Ashes, was the latest high-profile figure in the sport to express disbelief and disillusion about the saga.

“It’s shit for the game,” Clarke said. “What needs to happen is keep the current MoU for the next 12 months, and allow the players to get back to what they do best. Cricket Australia, the ACA, please go behind closed doors and sort this in private.

“The players want to play ... let’s allow them to play while this stuff gets sorted out in the background.” Clarke added it was a common solution to protracted pay talks during his 115-Test career.

“I don’t want the Australian players to be unprepared because they have been concentrating on something else; give them 12 months and let them concentrate on the cricket,” he said.

“I don’t want to see any cricket missed. There will be a compromise. The ACA and Cricket Australia will find a way to make this work.”

The gifted batsman’s suggestion has been successfully adopted in bargaining negotiations across many industries.

However, the major issue with Clarke’s answer to the crisis is that domestic and international women weren’t part of the previous agreement. A desire to bring both male and female players into the same MoU is one of few areas that the governing body and union agree on.

As such, it’s understood both CA and the ACA never seriously canvassed rolling over the previous deal as an option. Nor will they.

Another potential issue with Clarke’s answer to the crisis, as put forward by Ian Healy at Tuesday’s event, is that it could merely let the angst fester and result in a repeat of non-existent negotiations.

“Once both parties knocked each other’s offer back, they’ve both sort of stood back,” Healy said. “Both groups are wonderful people and they really care about cricket. They’ll get it done, but get some strategy going please!”

Healy, a former ACA president who played 119 Tests, noted he was staggered by the lack of progress in discussions. The union continues to call for CA boss James Sutherland to enter emergency mediation. The governing body continues to insist that won’t happen.

Former South Africa captain Graeme Smith threw his support behind Steve Smith and the ACA overnight.

“In the current cricket environment where players have other options I don’t understand why a board would want to change a partnership that has proved to be successful,” Smith said in a statement released by the Federation of International Cricketers’ Associations.

Manny Pacquiao has asked the World Boxing Organisation to act on a request by Philippine sports officials for a review of his welterweight world title loss to Jeff Horn, saying he didn’t want to see the boxing industry “dying because of unfair decision and officiating”.

Jeff Horn: from underdog to millionaire poster boy for sport in need of a wholesome hero | Russell Jackson Read more

While Pacquiao has accepted his defeat to Horn, who was fighting in his first world title bout in Sunday’s so-called “Battle of Brisbane”, the Philippine senator on Wednesday said that as a leader and boxer he has “the moral obligation to uphold sportsmanship, truth and fairness in the eyes of the public”.

The 11-time world champion cited a request by the Philippines’ Games and Amusements Board to WBO president Francisco Valcarcel for a thorough review of the refereeing and judging.

Horn was declared the winner at Suncorp Stadium by a unanimous points decision. The three judges scored the bout 117-111, 115-113, 115-113 in the Australian’s favour.

Pacquiao accepted the judges’ decision at the time and said he was keen for a rematch as soon as possible. That is likely to happen before the end of the year, with Brisbane again the most likely venue.

Pacquiao’s seventh loss of his professional career triggered an immediate uproar from boxing fans, mostly based in the United States and Philippines, who believed Pacquiao should have been awarded the victory.

One judge in particular, New Yorker Waleska Roldan, has come in for scathing criticism over her 117-111 scorecard.



The WBO tweeted on Wednesday: “The discretion of a referee or judge cannot be reversed, except in a case of fraud or violation of laws which is not the case in Pac vs Horn.”



Meanwhile, the recriminations are continuing inside Pacquiao’s camp. His promoter, Top Rank boss Bob Arum, and advisor Michael Koncz have both attacked referee Mark Nelson for letting Horn get away with putting Pacquiao in headlocks and punching while holding him.

But Arum blamed Pacquiao’s long-time trainer Freddie Roach for not “yelling at the referee” between rounds to alert him to it. “The corner didn’t have a strategy. They were all amazed Jeff Horn was such a tough, rugged fighter and they didn’t adapt to it,” Koncz said.

“There’s a lot of blame to go around but the bottom line is the kid had a lot of heart and came to win and did everything he could to get it, and the referee let him do more than he should have.”

Jeff Horn won a bloody and brutal fight in Brisbane, scoring a unanimous decision victory over Manny Pacquiao on Sunday. In front of a packed hometown crowd at Suncorp Stadium, Horn punched his ticket to boxing’s big time with an incredible performance to claim Pacquiao’s WBO welterweight championship.

The three judges scored the closely-fought bout 117-111, 115-113, 115-113 in Horn’s favour. Horn immediately called out Floyd Mayweather Jr. after the fight and declared himself “no joke” to the legions of boxing experts across the world who gave him no chance and mocked his credentials.

However, a rematch with Pacquiao later in the year – most likely at Etihad Stadium in Melbourne – looks a near-certainty after one of the biggest boxing upsets in recent memory.

“I’ve just believed since I was very young that I could do this,” Horn said. “This is not the best moment of my life – it is yet to come with my beautiful wife Joanna, she’s pregnant with our first child.”

Pacquiao said he accepted the judges’ decision but was keen to fight Horn again as soon as possible. “I didn’t expect [he would be] that tough,” he said.

Pacquiao’s trainer Freddie Roach tipped on the morning of the fight that Horn would not last three rounds. But intent on silencing his doubters and making a name for himself in front of a television audience in the tens of millions, Horn went the full 12-round distance with one of the greatest boxers of the era and came out on top.

Confounding predictions he would be chewed up and spat out by the 11-time, eight-division world champion, Horn came out firing and gave his opponent plenty of cause for concern from the very first round. Both fighters had their moments and traded turns as the aggressor and while Pacquiao may have landed more hits, Horn, 29, never stopped coming.

The defeat is Pacquiao’s first since losing to Mayweather in their 2015 clash in Las Vegas, taking his career record to 59-7-2 (38 knockouts).

After a relatively subdued build-up, both sides dispensed with the niceties in the hours before the fight as bickering broke out over what hand wraps were permitted. Roach objected to Horn’s use of brown wrapping tape and reportedly told Main Event presenter Ben Damon that he’d “never met such fucking disrespectful people in boxing. Manny knows about it and they’re gonna pay.”

Horn’s trainer Glenn Rushton suggested Roach looked “rattled” but agreed to use white tape to ensure there were no further problems.

The humble Australian’s life was transformed overnight, even though the classic warning signs of an upset against Manny Pacquiao were there from the start

Jeff Horn woke on Monday unable to see a thing from his swollen, bruised right eye, but having vanquished Manny Pacquiao in one of Australian sport’s greatest underdog victories, boxing’s unlikeliest world champion will now watch his life’s fortunes transform dramatically. The former Brisbane schoolteacher, who had only twice boxed for prize purses of five-figure proportions, is now the millionaire poster boy for a sport craving a wholesome hero.

Horn has quickly and predictably been dubbed the Australian Rocky. Though his actual nickname, The Hornet, alludes glancingly to the world of superhero fiction, his famous victory in front of an Australian record boxing crowd at Suncorp Stadium on Sunday surprised even his most ardent admirers – the people who knew of the thousands of hours of punishing training sessions, and the years of relentless physical and financial toil required just to get Horn into the ring for his one big shot.

Manny Pacquiao beaten by Jeff Horn in one of boxing's greatest upsets Read more

That nothing at all pointed to a victory for the humble, hard-working Australian will only add to its lustre in years to come, but in truth, the classic warning signs of a boilover were there from the start too: a brilliant champion taking his diligent challenger too lightly; the exuberance of youth overcoming the battle-weary old stager; an underdog lifted to new and unprecedented heights by a parochial home crowd.

Like all great overnight sensations of boxing, Horn’s success has resulted from years of hard graft – first to fight for his country in the 2012 Olympics, and since turning pro, the 17-fight undefeated run that put him in the frame for his first great pay day against Pacquiao. Perhaps Horn will not remain a household name around the world for very long, but his sheer Queenslanderness (training sessions in an investment-guru-turned-boxing-trainer’s salmon-pink mansion in suburban Stretton, you say?) has made this moment particularly sweet in his home state.

Horn is now a cane toad sporting hero to rank with Allan Border, Greg Norman, Wally Lewis and Johnathan Thurston, or at the very least jockeying with battlers like Steven Bradbury for the cult classic slot. Before the Pacquiao bout, the Euphoric Queensland Memes page ran a headline that summed up the contender’s down-to-earth charm: “Jeff Horn begins pre-fight ritual by drinking large glass of Brisbane River water.” In that city at least, he’s unlikely to have to buy himself a beer for the rest of his life.

It has not come without bitterness. There are those who feel the Australian, regardless of his pluck and spirit, might have been fortunate with the judges who scored his points win. Fox Sports boxing commentator Paul Upham is not among them. “People say Manny Pacquiao did enough to win. I don’t want to hear that,” Upham tells Guardian Australia. “Tell me in rounds. Round by round, how many did you score for Pacquiao and how many for Horn?

“Show me yesterday where Manny Pacquiao won seven rounds. He didn’t win seven rounds. He could have won the fight in the ninth round, but there is no way he won seven rounds. People say the scoring was controversial. It wasn’t.”

Play Video 1:10 WBO welterweight winner Jeff Horn: 'I have climbed the Pacquiao mountain' – video

This is also a victory over stereotypes. For so long Australian fighters have begged for major bouts like this one and been overawed when their moment finally arrived. Not so Horn, who had one of the greatest pound-for-pound fighters in the world flustered and bleeding from the early rounds. A common theme of the reaction to the result is that Pacquaio didn’t respect his opponent enough, but what telling disrespect of reputation it took from the Australian too, refusing to allow himself a single moment’s hesitation.

What is certain is that when the rematch does occur (and that will be at Pacquiao’s whim, because the boxing great will need to fit it in with his senatorial commitments in the Philippines), Pacquiao will be far better prepared, perhaps having relieved himself of the hangers-on who treated this first fight like it would be a walk in the park.

Yet Horn retains a serious chance to repeat his remarkable feat and move his career into new realms. One of the major question marks heading into this first fight was whether the underdog could step up from beating B-grade fighters to matching it with A-grade ones, albeit of the veteran class. Having done it once, it is not inconceivable he could do it again.

Regardless of the outcome of the rematch, Horn’s life is transformed. He’ll pocket $1m for this first win – possibly paying off his $300,000 mortgage in the process – then net $2m or more for the rematch; small change next to the eight-figure windfalls of his opponent but an entirely different life compared to his bare bones existence as an amateur. If he beats Pacquiao again, unification bouts await. Only when he holds all three belts will he be considered an undisputed champion of the world.

“It’s changed his life forever,” says Paul Upham. “It’ll never be the same again, but I don’t think he’s a guy we’ll see with fast cars and lots of toys. Jeff will be just fine. He’s very humble. But regardless of what he does for the rest of his career, he’ll always have this. To see those scenes at the end of the fight. Wow. It’s just a once in a lifetime dream, isn’t it?”

Whether this transforms boxing’s image in Australia also remains to be seen, but it now has the respectable star it has been crying out for, plus rare real estate on the front and back pages of newspapers and the lead slot on TV news bulletins. Horn, on the other hand, is faced with the boxer’s perennial dilemma: it is one thing to become world champion, quite another to stay on top.

• Results suggest fans in Britain have least confidence in football • And 74% say sports put making money ahead of providing entertainment

A string of doping and corruption scandals have left one third of British people with even less confidence in sport than they had a year ago, according to a survey.

Faith in administrators who run sporting organisations and the athletes themselves has been corroded by further revelations of corruption within Fifa and the doping suspicions that continue to dog Team Sky and Sir Bradley Wiggins.

Fifa report claims FFA made 'improper payments' in 2022 World Cup bid Read more

A survey of 2,000 people in Britain found one third believe their “trust in the sport industry has declined in the last 12 months”.

The research appears at the heart of a new report on the future of sport seen by the Guardian and published on Wednesday by the strategic communications consultancy, the Brewery at Freuds.

Despite recent doping scandals predominantly involving athletics and cycling, it is football that fans have the least amount of confidence in, with 36% saying they do not trust the sport at all. This damning indictment of the state of national game appears to stem from the corruption at the heart of the world governing body, Fifa.

However, some of those surveyed mentioned feeling disenfranchised, with the money at the top of the game failing to translate into cheaper ticket prices for fans. A total of 74% agreed that sports today are more “concerned with making money than providing entertainment and enjoyment for their fans”.

This poses a threat to the sport industry, with one in four fans saying recent events make them less likely to attend a match and three in 10 saying they would be less likely to buy merchandise.

A perceived disconnect between multimillionaire players and those on the terraces was also cited as a reason for lacking trust. One man surveyed said: “They’re a bunch of overpaid tossers. I grew up watching a bunch of local lads who had come from nothing. Now they’re not local any more, they don’t care.”

Another said: “I don’t think I’ll ever go again. When I used to go as a kid, the atmosphere was electric. Now there’s so much money in it, it doesn’t feel real any more.”

There were some encouraging findings from the report, with a large majority recognising the important role sport can play in society. More than three quarters (77%) claimed to see elite sport as inspirational and 73% say the diverse backgrounds of sporting stars in the UK today is a celebration of a multicultural society. Seven in 10 (71%) believe sport is a force for good.

Tanni Grey-Thompson, who contributed to the report, said: “Sport has to work harder than ever to safeguard its reputation and to maintain the special relationship it has with fans. This report demonstrates that this is a time of huge change – and opportunity – across the industry. It is vital we all continue to examine what more needs to be done.”

That was Mike Atherton’s verdict on the decider to a Test series that caught the national imagination and culminated in a battle for the ages in Leeds

When Donald roared but Cork had the last laugh

When England last won a Test series at home to South Africa, the Spin wasn’t even a glint in the Guardian’s eye. Life was pretty different in 1998: cricket was on the BBC, there was no DRS and elite sport was still a place where male hormones could run riot. England’s 2-1 win over South Africa was less a Test series, more a testosterone series; an unyielding arm-wrestle between two tough yet fragile sides with more in common than they would ever admit at the time.

Any recap of the series focuses on the contest between Mike Atherton and Allan Donald at Trent Bridge in 1998. Quite right, too: it was as good as sport gets. Yet that sometimes obscures what followed, a captivating dogfight in the series decider at Headingley. “It was the nastiest, most ill-tempered match that I have ever played in,” wrote Atherton in his autobiography, “and throughout it was clear that neither side had much regard for the other.”

When one-day cup’s September spot provided all the narratives needed | The Spin Read more

It was not entirely edifying, but the Spin loved every minute of it. Passive aggression and hold-me-back posturing have replaced the authentic needle that could make 20th-century sport so compelling. It’s surely possible to appreciate controversy and aggro without turning into Danny Dyer. It rouses players to great performances, it heightens the experience of supporting your team. And the sight of grown men losing their rag will always be very, very funny.

England had no right to be playing a series decider. They were thrashed in the second Test at Lord’s and held on nine wickets down to draw the third at Old Trafford. They squared the series with a deceptively uncomfortable eight-wicket win at Trent Bridge, where Atherton withstood Donald’s furious assault, which meant it was 1-1 going into the final Test at Headingley.

Time takes the edge off past experiences. Youthful heartbreak becomes cute and nostalgic, exams were never important anyway, and a series decider against South Africa 19 years ago is just detail in the pages of Wisden. Yet at the start of August 1998, the South Africa series was England’s world entire – a chance to win a major Test series for the first time in 12 years, and to put cricket on the front pages. It meant just as much to South Africa, who were desperate for victory in England after blowing a lead in 1994. Both sides didn’t want to win; they ached to win.

South Africa were a bloody difficult side, easily the best of the rest after Australia, but they had a burgeoning reputation for choking. In his wonderful autobiography, White Lightning, Donald evokes the tension at their team meeting the night before. “I looked across at big Brian McMillan, who was brought back for his first Test of the series, and he was very quiet, not even having a beer.”

McMillan was part of a five-man seam attack that is almost a who’s who of modern South African cricket: Donald, Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini, Jacques Kallis and McMillan would end their careers with 1,507 Test wickets between them, although in 1998 only Donald and Pollock were at their peak.

Ticket sales for the match exceeded £1m. There was no Olympics that summer and the Premier League season hadn’t started, so cricket was the big news. “It was great fun turning up to a Test where the whole country was talking about it,” said Nasser Hussain. Then the match started. “It was hell,” he said in his autobiography. “I can’t remember sleeping much.”

England started well, with Mark Butcher elegantly wasting the South African attack to reach a maiden Test century full of handsome drives. “He struck 18 fours in his 116, some of them apparently hit for sheer pleasure without a thought for survival,” said Wisden. However, the controversial dismissal of Mark Ramprakash – caught behind when the ball seemed to bounce in front of Mark Boucher – sparked a miserable collapse from 181 for three to 230 all out. Apart from Butcher, nobody reached 25. Hussain and a young Andrew Flintoff, who would get a pair in his second Test, also had reason to be aggrieved by their dismissals.

Most felt England had blown it. Atherton recalls Darren Gough marching into the England dressing-room at the end of the day to proffer an alternative analysis. “Fuck me, it’s like a morgue in here,” he said. “I’ll lay anybody money we get a first-innings lead tomorrow.” In the South African dressing-room, Donald, who had again bowled majestically, felt uneasy. “I looked around the guys and wondered yet again who really fancied it at this stage of a hard series,” he said. “We soon found out.”

South Africa couldn’t get away from England on the second day. A late burst of wickets from the heroic Angus Fraser – who took his third consecutive five-for the day before his 33rd birthday – restricted them to 252 all out, a lead of 22. “Gus,” said the captain Alec Stewart, “has got a heart the size of the biggest thing you can think of.” With Flintoff then no more than a promising change bowler and Ian Salisbury not really trusted, England effectively had a three-man attack of Fraser, Gough and Dominic Cork – not just in the match, but in the series. They took 59 of the 65 wickets to fall to England bowlers. (England’s spinners, Robert Croft, Ashley Giles, Ramprakash and Salisbury had combined figures of one for 440.)

There was more controversy, with Gary Kirsten and Donald wrongly given out LBW. By now there was all kinds of scrutiny on the umpires, Peter Willey and the Pakistani Javed Akhtar. “Everyone was appealing for anything because we had lost confidence in the umpires, especially Akhtar,” said Donald. “It was every man for himself.” The paranoia compounded an already unpleasant mood. “England really climbed into us,” said Donald, “and the aggro was worse than any match I’ve ever known against Australia, the disciples of hard cricket.”

Boucher was alleged to have racially abused Butcher, leading to a rollocking from Donald – “You’re a South African, representing a new country, the old ways have gone for good, go and find Butcher and apologise” – while Ramprakash’s attempted joke about Christians being eaten by the Lions went down extremely badly with the religious players in the South Africa side, particularly Jonty Rhodes.

The third day started dreadfully for England, with the talismanic Atherton wrongly given out LBW to the first ball from Donald, a kind of karmic payback for his reprieve in the previous Test. Hussain, so often at his best on bad wickets, gritted his way through the rest of the day to make 83 not out. The wicket of Ramprakash just before the close gave South Africa an in, but they were still in big trouble: on a spicy pitch, England led by 184 with six wickets remaining.

By now Donald’s ankle was full of cortisone and he could barely feel his legs. He sat in the bath and told the team’s assistant coach that after bowling nearly 250 overs in the series, he had nothing left to give. The following morning he went to the well one last time and produced a brilliant spell of 9.2-5-14-4. It showcased both his brawn and brain – he had Graeme Hick and Flintoff caught off slower balls – and sparked an England collapse from 206 for four to 240 all out. (England, striving doggedly for consistency, lost their last six wickets for 34 in both innings.) Donald finished with eight wickets in the match and 33 at 19.78 in a magnificent personal series.

The players on both sides were leaving bits of their soul all over the Headingley pitch. When Hussain was out for 94, he was so distraught that he walked off with his batting glove covering his eyes, oblivious to a standing ovation from the crowd. As he left the field he punched the boundary rail – not because he had failed to reach a hundred, but because he knew another 50 runs would have made England safe.

It was nonetheless an immense innings, spread over 341 balls and 421 minutes. “This is an impatient age, weaned on instant entertainment,” wrote our own David Hopps, who must love the world now if he felt like that in 1998, “but England won a Test series because a man toiled for more than seven hours for 94.”

South Africa were left chasing 219 to win the series. The match took another twist when Gough, Fraser and umpire Akhtar reduced them to 27 for five. At least one and possibly three of the South Africans had reason to be aggrieved. When Hansie Cronje was given out caught behind off the pad – a mistake from Willey rather than Akhtar – he walked off smiling sarcastically. Gerhardus Liebenberg, who concluded a desperate personal series (59 runs at 9.83) with a dodgy LBW, hurled his bat and helmet at the dressing-room wall.

Rhodes, who never batted better than on that trip, launched a chipper counter-attack, supported by McMillan, an underrated, grizzly bear of an all-rounder who got high on conflict. He was Rambo with a solid forward defensive. The pair batted beautifully to take South Africa’s target below 100. With Pollock and Boucher still to come, they were now favourites. Salisbury could no longer be risked after bowling eight overs for 34, and England were running out of options.

Hussain suggested bringing back Cork to bowl bouncers and pick a fight with McMillan. A year before he became England captain, this was Hussain’s first masterstroke. The duel began just before tea, and the two exchanged unpleasantries as they walked off. McMillan suggested, in not entirely polite terms, that the majority of what came out of Cork’s mouth had not been appropriately filtered through his brain. “Yeah big nose,” replied Cork, “let’s see how you go after tea.”

McMillan was a beast of a man, with the kind of hands that could crush a human head. On this day, his masculinity was his downfall. Cork got in his face and then in his head, challenging him repeatedly with the short ball and the big mouth. There was none of the nobility of Atherton v Donald and little of the quality, yet McMillan v Cork was just as important to the series outcome.

Cork had heard that McMillan used to be in biker gangs in Johannesburg. Most would have taken this as a warning to keep extremely quiet. “Come on Brian, you’re a biker,” said Cork, “but if you’re a really big man I’ll bowl a bouncer and you’ll hit me out of the park.” McMillan was suckered into a hook and top-edged it straight to Stewart. “I couldn’t believe,” said Donald, “that a man of his experience was conned out by a blusterer like Cork.” Even before the ball had been caught, Cork was triumphantly clenching his first in McMillan’s face. McMillan’s internal monologue at that precise moment is surely one of the great pieces of lost comedy. He still hadn’t got over it the next day when, according to Gough, he went looking for Cork “to offer something more than a congratulatory handshake”.

Misbah and Younis did more than serve Pakistan – they served cricket Read more

Rhodes fell to Gough for a tremendous 85, and the dismissal of Boucher soon after brought Donald to the crease with 44 needed and two wickets remaining. England’s bowlers were tiring, but Cork’s mouth was still in full working order. When he hit Donald in the chest with a short ball he shouted, “Look at the big fella now!” Donald, who like most of the South Africans thought Cork’s talk:walk ratio left a lot to be desired, growled in his face “Fuck off! You’re the big fucking pretender, let’s see how you go!”

Donald and Pollock, who was batting beautifully, took South Africa to within 34 of victory by the scheduled close. An extra half-hour was possible if one side claimed it and the umpires agreed a result was possible. England were desperate to get off the field. Fraser’s back had gone, Gough was suffering with stomach cramps and Cork had bowled a long spell. Salisbury was about to come back into the attack. South Africa dithered, unsure of the rules, and Stewart took advantage by marching off the field. When Donald and Pollock belatedly tried to object, Stewart brusquely announced, “Keep walking, we’ll come back tomorrow.” Paul Adams, the 12th man, had been too slow getting on the field with a message from Cronje to carry on.

For the players of both sides, the night of Sunday 9 August was like a twisted Christmas Eve, a cocktail of impatience, hope, expectation and a whole heap of fear. Hussain had a few rum and cokes to try to help him sleep; he still woke up at 5am. Fraser had an injection in his back. Gough was physically sick on the hard shoulder of the M1 and spent large parts of the evening on the toilet before he was given sleeping pills and Imodium. Atherton’s stomach cramps were even more severe – he went to hospital on the Monday morning and heard the result in a taxi on the way back to the ground.

Gough still felt dreadful when he walked on to the field for his warm-up. Then he heard the roar, from 10,000 people who had taken advantage of free entry and the chance to see England win a major series, and felt a rush of medicinal adrenaline. “I’ve never experienced a lift like it.”

It took 28 minutes for England to win the series. Donald was caught behind off Fraser, and then Gough trapped Ntini leg-before. This has always been perceived as another dodgy decision. That may have been the case in 1998, when players were infrequently given out on the front foot, but in 2017 it looks stone dead. England won by 23 runs and Gough finished with six for 42 – his best Test figures, to win a series on his home ground.

England won seven Test series in the 1990s: four against New Zealand, two at home to an India team that was hopeless overseas, and this. It stood out a mile. Although South Africa were starting to cement their contradictory reputation as hard-nosed chokers, they were still a tremendous side. They responded to the defeat in England by winning 10 of their next 11 Test series, and in the first decade after readmission they lost only two series against sides other than Australia. It felt like a breakthrough for English cricket; nobody knew that, a year later, they would be residing at Rock Bottom. In the Guardian, Paul Weaver said it was “a glorious reaffirmation of the summer game and a reminder of the importance of a winning side. If England had lost … well it is too awful to contemplate”.

England’s celebrations were compromised by a decision to allow cameras into the dressing room, which some of the players resented. Soon the cameras went and the private party started. They left a 20-minute voicemail for the injured Graham Thorpe and called Robert Croft, whose batting had saved the third Test and kept England in the series. Some of the England players missed the ensuing all-day session – the Lancashire pair of Atherton and Flintoff, for example, had to fly to Southampton for a NatWest Trophy semi-final – but the rest celebrated in an appropriate manner. Most of them, anyway; Gough was still so ill that he couldn’t drink champagne.

England’s win, though ultimately deserved, felt like a bit of a heist. South Africa dominated the first three-quarters of the series and finished it with an average of 35 runs per wicket – six more than England. They raged with impotent frustration at the result, particularly because of the umpiring. They paid the team their full win bonus of £2,700 each, though the UCBSA managing director Dr Ali Bacher later said that was as a reward for playing 16 Tests in 10 months rather than the perception of a moral victory.

Bacher later told the King Commission – set up after Cronje was exposed as a match-fixer – that he had been told Akhtar was bribed by a bookmaker. Akhtar denied it and sued for libel, Bacher ignored the summons to Pakistan and the whole thing petered out. The Bhandari Commission, set up in Pakistan to investigate match-fixing, later cleared Akhtar of any wrongdoing. (There was a strange postscript at the 1999 World Cup: Akhtar’s errant umpiring was one of the reasons for England’s elimination at the group stage. Had England gone through instead of Zimbabwe, South Africa would have finished above Australia at the Super Six stage and therefore would have gone through when their epic semi-final ended in a tie.)

“The inescapable fact is that we bottled it,” said Donald. “No amount of complaints about umpires would alter that. Judged by the highest standards, we failed.”

Donald was the tragic hero of the series – the champion who ended up on the losing side. He so nearly won the third, fourth and fifth Tests for South Africa. In the third at Old Trafford, with South Africa one wicket away from a 2-0 lead, he speared an inswinging yorker into the pad of Fraser. As he launched into an appeal, Donald thought, “That’ll do!”. In this series, it was unwise to make any assumptions about the umpiring.

When Ntini was dismissed at Headingley, a numb Donald sat for 30 seconds before dragging himself from his catatonia to shake hands with all the England players. “There was nothing more to give, nothing else to be said.”

Sir Dave Brailsford has attempted to brush away questions about his future and the credibility of his Team Sky squad three days from the start of their attempt to win a fifth Tour de France in six years.

Brailsford was also forced to deny that his team have a credibility issue. “I’m very focused on the race,” he said. “I’ve been involved in this sport for a long time and I’ve tried to do it absolutely the way I’ve always thought it should be done and I’m very proud of what we’ve achieved in this sport. I’m proud of this team and I’m proud to be sitting here.”

Team Sky have faced eight months of scandal including a UK Anti-Doping inquiry into allegations of possible wrongdoing and the revelation the team acquired 55 doses of the corticosteroid triamcinolone over three seasons, but cannot supply paperwork to account for its use. But Brailsford said he did not think Team Sky would be under any more of a spotlight than usual. “We’ve always been under more scrutiny than other teams. We’ve raced in France this year, we’ve raced abroad, been a very positive reception on the roadside. That’s how I would see it.”

After speculation in March about his future at Team Sky amid rumours that some riders at the team had questioned him, Brailsford said he had no plans to leave. “I love it. I absolutely love it. I’m proud of cycling in Britain and everything that’s been achieved, proud of these lads, proud of Team Sky.

“I’m going nowhere. I’ll be here next year, the year after, the year after. I’m passionate about it. I’m pretty patriotic, we’ve built something from scratch including British Cycling, we’re a global team with riders from different countries and it’s a privilege to be amongst these lads. You’ve got to remind yourself at times how special that is. It’s not the day job, it’s a privileged thing to be doing. I love it.”

The three-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome said he had total trust in the team as he launches the defence of his title. “I’ve been part of this team since the beginning and I’ve never seen anything untoward going on. I don’t have any trust issues.”

Chris Froome: This Tour de France route is biggest challenge of my career Read more

Froome said he expected a friendlier reception than in the past. “I was racing at the Dauphiné, it was a great atmosphere on the road and I don’t expect it to be any different for the next few weeks.

“The Tour is a tradition for the French fans and that’s one of the great things about it, it’s part of the spirit of the race, it’s beautiful and unique and those fans shouldn’t change anything.”

“If feelings on the bike and numbers in training are anything to go by I’m ready for the next three weeks,” said Froome, adding that he has the same hunger for the Tour this year as in the past. “The hunger definitely hasn’t got any less for me. I’m as motivated as ever. I’ve got so much more to race for now. This is potentially a fourth Tour de France title that I’m here to try and get. The challenge is bigger, the level of my rivals is higher on a difficult course so I’m here with all the motivation I’ve had before, if not more.”

Bernard Tomic’s embarrassing Wimbledon performance has former Australian players cringing, says Pat Cash, after the player confessed in a stunning post-match admission to feeling bored during his insipid 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 first round loss to German veteran Mischa Zverev and not being really concerned by his grand slam results.

‘Bored’ Tomic crashes out of Wimbledon and questions own commitment Read more

He also acknowledged having a mental issue – lacking motivation and not respecting the sport enough. His comments at the sport’s biggest showpiece prompted former Wimbledon champion Cash to caution Tomic about the Australian tennis legacy he was jeopardising.

“I don’t think Bernie by a long shot represents everybody, Australian players,” Cash told the BBC. “He can do a lot worse than that to ruin the image that we’ve created. But a lot of ex-players are cringing, Aussies, especially the guys who started this pro circuit. We wouldn’t be here without these guys.”

Australian six-time grand slam doubles champion Rennae Stubbs labelled Tomic’s comments a disgrace. “You’re an embarrassment to yourself, and not only to the sport but to Australian tennis,” Stubbs told the BBC.

Leading Australian tennis coach and commentator Roger Rasheed said 24-year-old Tomic needed help and agreed he should walk away from the game for a time. “The problem is, where does he go?” Rasheed told Sky Sports Radio.

“I don’t know where it [support] is going to come from, to be honest. You’d like to help the kid, as a person, just to talk to him to see what he’s interested in doing as a passion and try to work with that.”

Despite being heard complaining of a back problem during a medical time-out midway through the match, Tomic later said he wasn’t too troubled by it. “It was definitely a mental issue out there,” he said. “I don’t know why, but I felt a little bit bored out there, to be completely honest with you.

“So I feel holding a trophy or doing well, it doesn’t satisfy me anymore. It’s not there. I couldn’t care less if I make a fourth-round US Open or I lose first round. To me, everything is the same. I’m going to play another 10 years, and I know after my career I won’t have to work again.”

Nine-time Wimbledon winner Martina Navratilova said Tomic should get out of the sport if that’s how he feels. “It’s disrespectful to the sport and disrespectful to the history of the sport. If you can’t get motivated at Wimbledon it’s time to find another job. The spectators paid good money to come here and watch Wimbledon and the guy shows up and doesn’t try, he can’t be bothered. Just stay at home.”

Bernard Tomic faces being docked a portion of his £35,000 prize money after a lifeless first-round defeat by the No27 seed, Mischa Zverev, after which the Australian confessed to being “bored” with tennis.

The 24-year-old – who earned the nickname “Tomic the Tank Engine” for seeming to give up during some matches – denied he had deliberately quit but did appear to lose interest after dropping the first set and offered little resistance in going down 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 in only 84 minutes.

However, that was merely the hors d’oeuvre to an extraordinary press conference in which Tomic conceded he is disillusioned with tennis and no longer cares whether he does well in grand slams – and he does not appear inclined to put in the work to make the most of his talent.

“It was definitely a mental issue out there,” said Tomic, who reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 2011 and the last 16 in 2016. “I felt a little bit bored, to be completely honest with you. It’s tough, you know.

“I’m 24. I came on tour at 16, 17. I have been around and feels like I’m super old but I’m not. I’m still 24 and it was tough to find motivation out there.”

Wimbledon officials confirmed to the Guardian that the referee’s office had been made aware of Tomic’s performance and comments, and was investigating them.

Kim Clijsters was among the former players who suggested Tomic is wasting his talent and should take a break, but he scoffed at the thought.

“No, I’m happy with my life,” he said. “It’s my choice. I know I have to work hard. For sure, I don’t do the right work but I feel holding a trophy or doing well doesn’t satisfy me any more. It’s not there.

“I couldn’t care less if I make a fourth-round US Open or I lose first round. To me, everything is the same.”

Tomic’s behaviour infuriated fans back home, with one tweeting that he “would have to be the laziest tennis player to ever step foot on court. I am embarrassed to call him a fellow Aussie”. Another said “Can we deport Bernard Tomic”?

His response was to suggest that his critics back home were probably sitting in front of computers earning A$50 an hour. “You know, I’m going to play another 10 years and I know after my career I won’t have to work again,” he added.

Zverev was surprised at the ease of his victory, given he had been well beaten by Tomic at Eastbourne last week. “He knows what to do on the grass court, knows what shots to use,” Zverev said. “He beat me quite easily a few days ago, so I was expecting a very tough match.”

Tomic sounded unconvinced when asked whether he would be willing to work harder to turn round his fortunes. “Sometimes I do, sometimes I don’t,” he said. “I’m just speaking the honest truth about it. When I was 19 and 20, and 20 or 25 in the world , I was enjoying it. But now it’s a rollercoaster and I just can’t seem to find the commitment to work hard, to enjoy and to lift trophies. Maybe I have to look at a few things and maybe play less tournaments.”

Tomic’s defeat was one of three more for Australian men on the second day as Thanasi Kokkinakis went down 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (2), 6-4 to the No29 seed, Juan Martín Del Potro, and Jordan Thompson lost 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (4) to the No25 seed, Albert Ramos-Viňolas.

With Nick Kyrgios retiring with a hip injury in the second set of his opener against Pierre-Hugues Herbert, and John Millman and Andrew Whittington also losing on Monday, it means Australia have suffered a humiliating first-ever Wimbledon first-round men’s wipeout.

Kokkinakis pointed out that tough draws were a part of the reason for the poor performance and also expressed sympathy for Tomic. “It’s tough for him,” he said. “There is a lot of pressure on him, obviously. He came up being so good. Hopefully he can get it together because he’s a really good player, especially when he’s switched on.”

Elsewhere, last year’s runner-up, Milos Raonic, had few problems in beating Jan-Lennard Struff 7-6 (5), 6-2, 7-6 (4) to book a second round against Mikhail Youzhny. “I’ve played him a bunch of times and lost to him the last time I played,” said Raonic, who is seeded No6. “I have to be very disciplined with myself.”

The No8 seed, Dominic Thiem, who reached the semi-final of this year’s French Open, produced one of his best performances on grass as he beat the big-serving Vasek Pospisil 6-4, 6-4, 6-3.

Alexander Zverev, Tomas Berdych, Grigor Dimitrov and Jack Sock were also among the seeds to comfortably make it to the second round. However the No19, Feliciano López, is out after retiring with an ankle injury while two sets to one down against Adrian Mannarino whose fellow Frenchman Richard Gasquet, the No22 seed, is also out after losing 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-2 to David Ferrer.

So much for Super Tuesday. One abrupt Centre Court retirement against an ex-champ several years your senior might be regarded as a misfortune. Two on the same afternoon starts to look like a moment of genuine oddity, not to mention a disaster for the ticket-buying public, TV broadcasters and indeed the All England Club itself on one of its gala high-summer afternoons.

Wimbledon’s Super Tuesday had promised much, with back-to-back tournament bows for two of the basking lions of men’s tennis. Centre Court was set fair, tickets expensively procured, queues braved. In the event there was just enough time for the crowd to gush and coo at the sight of first Novak Djokovic and then the great Roger himself, to lose itself in a little of that old champion voodoo.

Wimbledon fans short-changed as Federer and Djokovic opponents retire Read more

At which point: exit music. Shortly before five o’clock Roger Federer played one last dreamy backhand drop-shot winner and suddenly Alexandr Dolgopolov was wincing ruefully and wandering off court. That whole stellar double bill was done in just over an hour and half, two sets and twin injury retirements by a pair of outsiders a decade younger than the combined age of their opponents.

Play Video 2:17 Federer and Djokovic afforded easy passage on Centre Court – video highlights

There were gasps around Centre Court, even a ripple of mild rebellion. An hour earlier Martin Klizan had retired at the same stage against Djokovic.

Klizan had taken to the court with his calf already strapped, winced around the place a bit and duly played out a set of his own before coming up lame.

There will, of course, be rumblings about this. Klizan will get £35,000 just for taking to the court and carrying his injured leg around for a while.

This is money well-earned in practice and preparation, the cycle of agony and toil that gets you here in the first place. But this was not in any sense a tennis match, or any kind of entertainment product worthy of the name.

Athletes struggle with injury all the time. Nobody gets out there without huge reserves of bravery and resilience. But something is amiss here. By the end of the second day of the championships the tally of retirements stood at seven men and one woman. As Djokovic suggested afterwards, it might be better to guarantee appearance money to those who make the draw, to allow a lucky loser to step in with no financial loss if injury strikes. Tennis is far from a gravy train for qualifiers and first-round losers. You can see the need to play.

Federer had sympathy for his opponent, suggesting players should only pull out if they are absolutely unable to go on, citing the chance that the other guy might twist an ankle or the skies close in. But then he can be excused believing in miracles. This is a veteran champ whose only really serious injury was sustained while running a bath for his daughters. The most remarkable thing about Federer isn’t that he is 35 years old. It’s the fact he is nearly 36, next month set to bring another meaningless notch on that friction-free timeline.

It is a shared theme right now: injury and physical stress set against the startling longevity of that stellar quartet at the very top. Roger, Rafa, Andy, Novak are all 30 or over now. There is surely an economic element to this sustained supremacy. The big four are like one-man city states, surrounded by teams of crimpers and fluffers, out there at the frontier of sports science and coaching, staring down from their moon base at the tiers of hopefuls below. Little wonder, perhaps, up against this there might be a temptation to buckle in the foothills.

For Centre Court these are precious moments to have lost. Walking out in mid-afternoon, Federer had received less a round of applause more a hormonal groan of longing. But then it can be hard to resist that allure, the waft of Fedromones, the way Federer walks out on court like the man who invented walking, seeming to move through even a muggy south London day with less resistance than the standard-issue human.

He is still a sensual pleasure to watch with a poise that can suck the air out of his opponents. Here Federer went to 4-2 with a service game of viciously controlled slice and cut, making Dolgopolov leap and jerk like a marionette. “I love you Roger,” shouted one of Those Blokes in the crowd, to titters and flushes of sympathy, hands raised to the collective throat.

“Marry me Roger” another wag yelled as he served to go to 5-3. And frankly Federer could have just stayed out after his opponent had winced his way off and run up and down a bit, hit from one end, done some press-ups. Centre Court would have still purred and cooed and goggled in a lascivious hush.

Earlier it had been Djokovic’s turn to appear briefly centre stage. He had time to look encouragingly ruthless, the ball dispatched on that familiar crouching forehand with a cat-stretch of the shoulder blades, all braced tensile energy. But then Klizan did fade almost from the start. For a while it was like watching Djokovic play against a service machine, or a dalek.

The fact neither Djokovic nor Federer was stretched here might be felt later in the tournament. But perhaps not as keenly as it was by a Centre Court crowd robbed of its own afternoon of champion grace.

It may have the best creche of any grand slam tournament, but playing Wimbledon still presents challenges for new mothers, the former No 1 Victoria Azarenka has found.

SW19 has seen at least four mothers of young children compete in singles games on its courts. And for Azarenka, 27, her first-round victory came just six months after giving birth to son Leo.

The unseeded Belarusian said her Wimbledon scheduling had been “tough” on her as a new mother, as she found herself in a “to be announced” match on Court 1 at the end of the day’s play and not finishing until 9pm.

Asked what it was like not knowing when she was due to play, she smiled: “It is unusual. You know I had to be here the whole day which, for a new mum, is a little tough.” She added: “Hopefully, I won’t play like this again.”

I guess my practice is not as interesting as eating your first credential ever! Leo decided to make it to Aorangi park just to chill on a beautiful grass on a sunny day! Will keep all white outfit for next week 😊 #bringyourbabytoworkday👶🏼 A post shared by Victoria Azarenka (@vichka35) on Jun 26, 2017 at 10:54am PDT

She had not brought son Leo with her to the grounds, saying it was too disruptive to his routine. “This is way past his bedtime. So I wouldn’t do that to him,” she said, after dispatching American CiCi Bellis 3-6, 6-2, 6-1 to make it to the second round.



Azarenka, a two-time Wimbledon semi-finalist who was No 1 in 2012 and is now ranked 683 – is one of only a few elite female players to come back after becoming mothers. The most successful was Belgian Kim Clijsters, a mother of three, who won three grand slams after giving birth to her first daughter.

Tatjana Maria, 29, from Germany, who returned to professional tennis after the birth of daughter Charlotte, four, said both Serena Williams’ pregnancy, if she returns to competing, and Azarenka’s had raised awareness of the issue.



Maria, who beat Russia’s Anastasia Potapova to reach the second round, said: “I hope it will mean that all the tournaments will have a creche, because in the men’s tournaments we sometimes have one, but in the women’s not. I hope that can change.

“Here [at Wimbledon] the creche is the best. You bring your children, they eat together, they do activities.



“It is the most beautiful thing in the world if you play a match, and after,you go to her and you see [that] to her it doesn’t matter how you play. She is always happy. If you win, she is, ‘OK mama, you won a trophy.’ Or if you don’t win, she says, ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter.’ And she also learns how to win and to lose. So that is nice.”

She said three female players were now using the creche more usually occupied by the children of male players: Ukrainian Kateryna Bondarenko, 30, Russian Evgeniya Rodina, 28, and herself. “Victoria’s baby is maybe a bit too little still,” Maria added.



Of combining motherhood with professional tennis, she said: “I think everybody should do it. It’s really nice. I spoke to Victoria [Azarenka] over the last days. She also said it is amazing to be back with a child, and it is. It’s nicer to travel with a child, to have time to enjoy as a family outside of the court.”



Maria said she had not experienced the scheduling uncertainties that Azarenka had seen. “But for her maybe it is a little bit different, because she is playing a big tournament right away. I started from zero, so it was a different story than to come right away to Wimbledon.”



Responding to Azarenka’s comments, a Wimbledon spokesperson said the match was “scheduled as ‘not before 5pm’ on the official order of play, so the competitors have the assurance of knowing their matches won’t be called to court before 5pm and can plan their day around that”.

AB de Villiers’ absence from the South Africa team at Lord’s this week has been called a “red flag” for Test cricket in a warning from the MCC World Cricket Committee about a looming crisis for the longest format amid the rise of domestic Twenty20 leagues.

De Villiers, the leading South African batsman of his generation, will not be a headache for England’s new captain, Joe Root, this Thursday as he is taking a sabbatical from facing the red ball. It began last year in a bid to manage his workload, and has recently been tipped to retire from Tests by the end of 2017.

The 33-year-old plays limited-overs international cricket and on the domestic Twenty20 circuit, leading the MCC World Cricket Committee chairman and former England captain, Mike Brearley, to describe his career choices as “symbolic of the problems” facing the sport.

Brearley, who has chaired the think tank since 2011 and now steps down from the role, also called on the International Cricket Council to press ahead with mooted plans for a world Test league, along with an “admittedly idealistic” plea for cricket boards to rethink the distribution of central funds in the world game.

“The game is facing – if not a crisis – a looming potential crisis,” said Brearley. “This crisis needs to be noticed and taken seriously. For international cricket to flourish, competitive levels need to be close and teams need to be able to field their best players.

“The committee is worried that with the spread of privately owned Twenty20 leagues and the rapid increase in remuneration, more players from counties lacking the funds to pay them well will choose these tournaments ahead of making themselves available for their countries.”

The former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum was also on the committee and said De Villiers’s decision was “another red flag moment”. He added the caveat that, like his own choice to play on in Twenty20 after retirement, lifestyle issues could be at play too.

As the MCC panel voiced their concerns in the Lord’s media centre, the Root era began in earnest on the Nursery Ground as the bat-and-ball flea circus that is England’s pre-match training whirred into life under sunny London skies in preparation for the first Investec Test.

Stuart Broad, who was here on Saturday as part of Nottinghamshire’s victorious Royal London Cup side and appears fit to play after recent heel trouble, said there was a different feel to proceedings, in part down to the new leadership but also due to the six-month break since the tour of India that ended in a 4-0 defeat and preceded Alastair Cook stepping down.

“It does feel like a new era with Joe as captain,” said Broad. “With the change of leadership it’s an obvious fresh start. I don’t think I’ve had a gap like this playing for England, which is nice as well because it reminds you how special it is and how lucky you are to be a part of it. I’m lucky enough to have played over a hundred Tests but this feels like a debut.”

Broad’s last encounter with South Africa culminated in a trademark burst, as his six for 17 in Johannesburg in 2016 sealed a series win – the last major triumph of Cook’s four-year tenure. Root is now the fifth captain Broad has had to impress, having made his debut under Michael Vaughan in 2008 before spells under Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Strauss.

Broad said: “Vaughan was very much ‘you set your own fields’; Strauss was a little bit more ‘I’ll set the field’ and Cook was very happy with the bowlers taking responsibility. I think Joe will probably go down that route as well. He’s an attacking person and I’d expect us to put a lot of pressure on a new batsman. He’ll very much lead the way he plays his cricket.

“I think every captain I’ve played under has very much been part of the team because that’s when you really get honest feedback and communication is at its best. I know there’s been a lot of talk about whether it will affect his batting but he’s one of the best players in the world for a reason – he can really concentrate on whatever he’s doing at a certain time.”

Cook is now back among the rank and file and the early signs are that he has been freed up, England’s record run-scorer having shone for County Championship pacesetters Essex this summer with three centuries and an average of 66.7.

Mark Wood: ‘I want to be a bowler that can change the game for England’ Read more

Broad said. “He’s absolutely loved being around the Essex changing room – it’s like when he was playing cricket as a kid, just for the love of playing cricket. He’s had quite a long period of the captaincy where there are different stresses, selection meetings etc. Now he just picks up his bat and plays. I think he’ll be extremely successful over the next couple of years.”

The selection issues for Root appear minimal for his first Test in the role. The one catch in a 12-man squad is whether to play Liam Dawson, a spin-bowling allrounder, or grant a debut to the Middlesex seamer Toby Roland-Jones on his home ground. Since the group was named last Friday, it has always pointed strongly towards the former.

In continuing on from the end of the India tour, Dawson’s tweak, along with that of Moeen Ali, would mean England fielding two spinners at Lord’s for the first time since 1993 – an innings and 62-run loss to Australia that saw Phil Tufnell and Peter Such share figures of four for 219.

To avoid talk of a “looming crisis” if ball doesn’t turn at Lord’s, it should be noted that Root, unlike Graham Gooch in that Ashes defeat, will still have four seamers at his disposal.

• Du Plessis had stood in for recent victories against New Zealand and Australia • De Villiers out of upcoming series against Sri Lanka with injury

AB de Villiers has relinquished the South African Test captaincy in order to focus on getting back to full fitness, with Faf du Plessis named as his successor.

De Villiers took up the mantle following Hashim Amla’s resignation midway through the England series in January this year but the dynamic right-hander has led the Proteas in just two Tests.

A persistent elbow injury, which required surgery, ruled De Villiers out of the series against New Zealand and Australia and Du Plessis stepped in to lead South Africa to impressive victories.

With De Villiers, 32, set to miss his third Test series in a row when Sri Lanka visit South Africa, he believes Du Plessis should succeed him as full‑time captain and the Cricket South Africa chief executive, Haroon Lorgat, confirmed the appointment.

Du Plessis, lollygate and the airport scuffle: needless faff over a trivial issue | Geoff Lemon Read more

De Villiers said: “The interests of the team must always outweigh the interests of any individual, including me. It was a fantastic honour for me to be asked to captain the Test side but I have missed two series and I am still in doubt for the upcoming series against Sri Lanka.

“Following the squad’s outstanding performances in Australia, it is clearly in the greater interests of the team that Faf du Plessis should be confirmed as the permanent Test captain.”

Lorgat said: “It is no surprise that the CSA Board has confirmed Faf du Plessis as the Test captain to take over from AB.”

De Villiers’ injury kept him out of the 1-0 win against the Kiwis while he was also absent for the surprise 2-1 win in Australia and is slated to miss the three-match series against Sri Lanka, which gets under way in Port Elizabeth on Boxing Day.

Dr Mohammed Moosajee, the Proteas team manager, said De Villiers, who remains captain of the one-day side, may be fit for the 50-over series between the teams.

“AB’s left elbow is much improved but is still regaining the last few degrees of straightening. Fitness to play requires a full range of elbow movement and this may take another three to four weeks to achieve. He will be unavailable for the Test series against Sri Lanka and will target a return for the ODI series starting at the end of January.”

The game, the tournament and the fans were seriously short-changed on Tuesday when Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer progressed to the second round after their opponents defaulted with barely a whimper between them, claiming injury. In total, seven men and one woman failed to finish their first round matches.

There was no discernible evidence Alexandr Dolgopolov brought his complaint to the court ready-wrapped, and he did give Federer at least a few moments of anxiety before twice refusing to chase down gettable returns in the second set then surrendering in the 43rd minute, much to the bemusement of the Centre Court patrons. It is thought his ankle gave up on him.

‘Bored’ Tomic crashes out of Wimbledon and questions own commitment Read more

The patient crowd had already had to digest the altogether more problematic exit of Martin Klizan, who hobbled off after 40 minutes against Djokovic favouring his calf – but not in visibly worse condition than when he started.

Djokovic said courtside: “I heard that he had issues even before walking on to the court. Of course you never like to end a match this way. I wish him all the best.”

He said later he joked with Federer in the locker room that maybe they should play a practice set to give the crowd some entertainment. He said he supported new LTA rules whereby an injured player is able to claim prize money but a lucky loser takes their place.

He added of the players who retired: “This tournament has a special place in players’ careers. In this sport there’s so much weight behind it and significance about it. The aura of Wimbledon has probably always been the strongest of any tournament. Especially if you walk out on the Centre Court, there is a responsibility. I’m sure they tried their best but it is what it is.”

Others were less understanding, John McEnroe was predictably the most vocal television critic. “It’s no good for anyone if a player in a one-on-one sport can’t compete on an equal level,” he told BBC viewers. “I don’t know who the first lucky loser was but he will have been looking out there and saying: ‘I could have been playing on the Centre Court at Wimbledon.’”

For the record that unlucky lucky loser was Klizan’s compatriot, Lukas Lacko, ranked 105 in the world, a battler who could have done with the £35,000 cheque for appearing – as well as the thrill of playing a three-times Wimbledon champion on the biggest stage in his sport.

There was nothing to be learned from Djokovic’s performance given he had so little to test himself against, but he served competently, took two of four break points, hit 20 clean winners and only six unforced errors. It was a decent practice session.

This 131st Wimbledon had already been blighted by Nick Kyrgios’s withdrawal mid-match on day one, and his fellow Australian, Bernard Tomic, who brought a back pain to his match against Mischa Zverev, and did not exactly leave graciously on day two. The one-time rising star declared after going down meekly in three sets to an opponent he beat on grass in Eastbourne last week, “I felt a little bit bored out there, to be completely honest with you.” That’s all right, then.

Surely, though, the fans thought, the sainted Federer would restore a semblance of decorum an a day of anarchy. It was not his fault that he could not fully deliver – nor really could the blame be laid at Dolgopolov’s sore ankle. He probably soldiered on longer than he wanted to because it just did not look good after the Klizan farce.

The stark contrast between Federer and any gifted but lesser player becomes obvious from the earliest exchanges. Dolgopolov is someone capable of great shots and, occasionally, a stunning result; Federer’s greatness resides in not only his longevity and 18 slams, but his unwavering faith in his own genius. At least they had that in common.

Dolgopolov is always good to watch, winning or losing, because of his wristy, rapid-armed serve and his willingness to go for big winners when small ones would do.

He hit nine winners and 15 unforced errors, including the dumped backhand to give up the first set inside half an hour and the double-fault for 0-2 in the second that precipitated his quickening descent.

When the Ukrainian, who called on the trainer after the first set, did not even move from the baseline to retrieve an admittedly wondrous backhand flick in the third game of the second, it seemed he might be taking the Klizan route. The crowd were left in disbelief when Federer hit a drop shot at 30-all in the fourth game and Dolgopolov could do no more than trot to the net and blushingly give up.

“I feel for the crowd,” said Federer. “They’re there to watch good tennis, proper tennis. At least they see the two of us who gave it all they had. They saw other players that tried at least.”

The only crowd buzz going in Dolgopolov’s favour was the occasional “aah” of sympathy, accompanied by the Centre Court speciality of polite but understated applause any time Federer drove a rapier shot past him, which was often.

He was 6-3, 3-0 up at the finish; along the way he became the third player in the game to hit 10,000 aces in his career, at 4-3 in the first set. A nugget of brilliance to remember, at least.

Djokovic had led 6-3, 2-0 against Klizan. Those are scores relevant only to future trivia contests.

Angelique Kerber has spent more weeks on the top of women’s tennis than Venus Williams and Maria Sharapova combined – longer, in fact, than all but 11 players in history. But now, more than ever perhaps, the crown sits precariously on her head.

Wimbledon 2017 day two: Novak Djokovic in action as Kerber wins – live! Read more

That much was obvious watching the No1 seed stumble past Irina Falconi, a qualifier from the US who has never won a match in five attempts at Wimbledon and is ranked 247 in the world.

On the face of it a 6-4, 6-4 victory in 87 minutes might not sound like it gives much cause for concern. But this was not the Kerber of last year, slugging out the final with Serena Williams in a minor classic before gracefully accepting the runners-up trophy. Instead she spent much of the match groping for her range and rhythm. The good news is that she still has time to find it, but a second-round match against Belgium’s Kirsten Flipkens, who reached the semi-finals in 2013, looms.

Play Video 2:17 Federer and Djokovic afforded easy passage on Centre Court – video highlights

“I think it will be another tough match,” Kerber said. “But I’m on my way to recapturing my form.”

Wimbledon tradition dictates that the defending singles champion begins the defence of her title on the first Tuesday. However with Williams expecting a first child, it was Kerber who was given the honour. The German has had a fitful year, and lost in the first round in Paris, but initially she played as if she had never been away from SW19 as she broke serve twice to go 3-0 up in the first set.

Yet suddenly and strangely, her forehands kept finding the net or going long. That gave Falconi confidence. She had already showed she had a lovely touch – a feathered volley to save a break point in the third game was rapturously applauded – but now she was winning games, too. The American broke back and kept it close throughout the rest of the first set before going down 6-4 in 48 minutes – but it was telling that Kerber had hit only eight winners to 13 unforced errors.

The second set was also close but with it poised at 4-4, Falconi threw away her service game and Kerber needed no second invitation to wrap up the match.

Wimbledon as a mother is a whole new ball game, says Victoria Azarenka Read more

Afterwards she admitted that the pressure of being No1 for 33 weeks had not always been easy, but insisted her form is gradually returning.

“There is much more expectation, much more pressure, from me, from outside, from everything,” Kerber said. “You have much more things also to do. You have to learn. You have to get through all the things. In the last few months, I’ve had a few up and downs. But there’s also a lot of things that I’ve learned from.

“Right now I am trying to make things not too complicated again and I’m feeling good,” she added. “I have been practising good in the last few weeks since Paris. I will try to go out there on Thursday, find my rhythm, and enjoy playing on grass. This is what I love.”

She knows, however, that she has 1300 ranking points to defend at Wimbledon. So unless she makes the latter stages she is likely to lose the top spot to the Czech player Karolina Pliskova or the Romanian Simona Halep. On this evidence, at least, the clock is ticking loudly.

If all goes to plan for Karolina Pliskova this Wimbledon, she could claim her first grand slam title and become the world’s No1 player along the way. Certainly how she played against the Russian Evgeniya Rodina, particularly in the first set when the No3 seed hit an astonishing 23 winners, suggests she deserves to be the bookies’ favourite. If anything her 6-1, 6-4 win underplayed her dominance.

“I know there’s a thing about becoming world No1 but I just don’t want to be focusing on this,” she said. “For me it’s just important to win the matches. I’m happy I passed the first round and I’m focusing on the next one.”

The 25-year-old has never made it past the second round in five appearances at Wimbledon but is full of confidence having won at Eastbourne last Saturday. However, she knows that her next opponent, Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia, a former Wimbledon semi-finalist in doubles, will be a hard test.

“It’s the toughest draw in the second round so far for me on the grand slams,” Pliskova said. “On grass I think she can be dangerous with her game. She can play a lot of slices, drop shots, serving well, also good at the net. I’m expecting a tough match, definitely.”

The No24 seed, Coco Vandeweghe, also advertised her credentials with a 7-5, 6-2 victory over the dangerous German, Mona Barthel. Vandeweghe, who reached the quarter-finals in 2015, praised her coach, Pat Cash, and said she hoped to emulate his 1987 victory at the All England Club. “He’s getting me to focus on coming forward and definitely putting my presence out there. It is the 30-year anniversary for Pat so I hope there is some magic that rubs off on to me.”

The No10 seed, Agnieszka Radwanska, was also impressive in holding off Jelena Jankovic 7-6 (3), 6-0 but quickly downplayed her chances of going far in the tournament. The 2012 finalist admitted she had not fully recovered from a foot injury that interrupted her clay court season and a virus after the French Open, and suggested she would be lucky to get to the last 16.

“I shouldn’t expect that much from myself, and I’m getting tight and nervous,” said Radwanska. “I didn’t really do much the last few weeks, just played a couple of practices and I’m here. But when you go on court, adrenaline and everything, and you kind of forget about that. Maybe I can play a couple of good matches.” The No5 seed, Caroline Wozniacki, had a tougher than unexpected struggle before getting past Timea Babos 6-4, 4-6, 1-6 in match which took place on Centre Court after the two injury retirements in the men’s singles left a slot to be filled for the crowd.

There was no joy for Sloane Stephens as she went down 6-2, 7-5 to her compatriot Alison Riske in her first match since the Rio Olympics. Stephens, who had to wear a boot for 15 weeks after suffering a stress fracture to her navicular bone in a foot, said she hopes it will not be long before she is climbing the rankings. “Obviously I have been practicsing and playing practice sets and matches, but it’s totally different when you get into a match situation.”

Tiger Woods says he’s checked out of the clinic where he went to get help dealing with pain medications, adding he will “continue to tackle this going forward”.

Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) By TW pic.twitter.com/AfHewS2uRL

“I recently completed an out of state private intensive program,” Woods tweeted. “I will continue to tackle this going forward with my doctors, family and friends. I am so very thankful for all of the support I’ve received.”

The treatment follows the golfer’s arrest in May on a DUI charge after he was found asleep at the wheel in Jupiter, Florida, around 2am. Woods told police he was taking various prescriptions. No alcohol was found in his system.

Woods said in a statement last month that he was receiving professional help to manage his medications and how he deals with pain and a sleep disorder. His agent confirmed that the 14-time major champion, who had back surgery in April, was seeking in-patient treatment.

In June, Woods’s agent Mark Steinberg spoke about the pain Woods has experienced due to his back issues. “Tiger has been dealing with so much pain physically. And that leads to insomnia and sleep issues. This has been going on for a long time. Was the night in question a tipping point? He’s now gone and checked himself into a facility,” he said. “He’s been in pain for so long. He’s had to handle the pain, which then potentially leads to the lack of sleep because you’re in so much pain.”

Woods has not played in a tournament since February. His last victory in a major came in 2008 at the US Open.

All-British matches have been few and far between at Wimbledon over the past 50 years – there have only been 18, in fact – which meant there was more interest than usual in the meeting between Kyle Edmund and Alex Ward here on Tuesday. Ward, whose world ranking has dropped to 869 after wrist injuries, took the first set before his rival won 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1.

Wimbledon 2017 day two: Kerber, Federer and Djokovic in action – live! Read more

But with Katie Boulter, James Ward – no relation – and Brydan Klein all going out, perhaps the best thing about the all-home match was that it guaranteed one Briton a place in the second round.

When Alex Ward, who came through qualifying, won the opening set, there were echoes of last year’s entertaining run by Marcus Willis, who reached round two when ranked No772 and lost to Roger Federer. Edmund, who had not won in four previous Wimbledon visits, looked nervous early on but the world No50 bounced back well and by the end he was a convincing winner. Ward will move up more than 300 places in the rankings for making the main draw while a relieved Edmund is certain to climb.

“It’s nice to get my first Wimbledon win,” he said. “The first set was tricky, even the first point he came out and really attacked me. It was just about trying to find ways, slowly turning momentum. Once I had that it started coming a bit easier, but well done to Alex, he qualified, he had a long injury lay-off and it’s good to see nice guys like him doing well.”

Ward said: “It’s been tough starting again this year from a low ranking. But experiences like this make the sacrifices all worthwhile. And today’s my mum’s 60th birthday, so playing that match was a nice present for her.”

Wimbledon fans short-changed as Federer and Djokovic opponents retire Read more

James Ward, making his way back from injury, was beaten 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 by Cyprus’s Marcos Baghdatis while Klein was also knocked out in straight sets, ousted by Japan’s world No44 Yuichi Sugita, leaving Andy Murray, Jo Konta, Heather Watson, Aljaz Bedene and Edmund to fly the home flag. Edmund’s reward for his win over Ward is a meeting with the Eastbourne finalist and No15 seed, Gaël Monfils.

“It will be difficult for me to break him down,” Edmund admitted. “He has very easy power. At the same time it’s a grass court, so it’s a little bit easier to hit through the court because of the nature of it and also you can wrongfoot or get players out of position a little bit easier on the grass and finish the points.”

The other Briton on show, the 20-year-old Boulter, went home disappointed after she was beaten 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 by Christina McHale of the US, a woman ranked 178 places above her at No60.

Boulter, on her grand slam debut, showed more than enough to suggest that she may have what it takes to be back on this stage on a regular basis. A fine mover, with an excellent backhand, she fought back from 5-2 down in the second set to be two games from victory.

But McHale, the only woman to take a set off Serena Williams here last year, snatched the set and then from 2-0 down in the third won six of the next seven games to clinch her place in round two.

Boulter said she was “completely devastated” at losing but proud of her performance. “It’s something that will give me a lot of confidence moving forward,” she said, adding her thanks to Wimbledon after receiving a wildcard. “It will push me into the next bracket of where I’m trying to reach.”

Swedish racing is “an emerging market” according to one of the officials charged with running it and on Tuesday night it made a bid for the attention of the wider racing world by staging an international jockeys competition under the strikingly bold title of the Lady Jockeys Thoroughbred World Championship. Hayley Turner and Sammy Jo Bell were among nine riders from various countries to compete here in front of a small but appreciative crowd including Benny Andersson of Abba fame, a longstanding racing fan.

“It’s a small sport in this country. Very small,” Andersson noted and even his money and support over decades have not been able to change that. But there is certainly ambition and also an urgency born of necessity. In 2019, Sweden will have to give up its monopoly over betting on racing, from which the sport has derived a steady income.

“We have to make a new and better product for the future,” said Dennis Madsen, head of racing at the ruling body, Svensk Galopp, which brought members of the foreign racing media here to see action at this track, opened just last year. The card was also broadcast live in Britain on Racing UK; Madsen would very much like to stimulate overseas interest in his sport, from both punters and owners of horses just below the highest class who might come here in search of a winning opportunity.

Madsen is struck by the fact that Swedish punters stake millions of euros each weekend on trotting racing, a sport almost unknown in Britain. There are dozens of trotting tracks here, against just three for the Flat racing familiar to British punters. Even a fraction of the turnover that trotting attracts would turn around racing’s finances. “If you reach for the sun, maybe you come to the stars and that would be good enough for us,” Madsen said.

This event cannot hope to live up to its title, at least not in year one and without the participation of any rider from North America. As is the nature of all international jockey competitions, the distribution of mounts can never be entirely fair. But everyone seemed to be having fun and France’s promising young Maryline Eon won a couple of races and the overall title to make up for her two saddles that were lost by a baggage handler between here and Paris. Danielle Johnson, who is about to finish second in the jockeys championship in New Zealand, won one race and went close in another.

Other jockeys also gave up more than just their time to be here; Sammy Jo Bell’s whip, alas, did not make it out of Manchester airport, where security staff told her: “You could do some serious damage with this.” Bell retorted: “It’s cushioned! I’d do more damage with my iPad if I hit someone with that!”

Hayley Turner made it, just hours after her winner at Windsor on Monday night, and insisted that this, her second comeback in as many years, will last no longer than the first. She enjoys taking part but is a broadcaster first and foremost these days.

Andersson was briefly disappointed to hear this, as he has a two-year-old filly, Sing A Rainbow, in training in England and wants a jockey. He would prefer a woman (“Because … why not?”) and suggests he will hire Josephine Gordon when his filly makes her debut.

Now 70, Andersson has lent his backing to this event but denies suggestions that it was his idea, pointing the finger instead at Derek Thompson, a ubiquitous presence for decades in British racing media who also, somewhat surprisingly, turns out to be influential in Scandinavia. He performed MC duties and introduced the jockeys to the crowd here in unapologetic English.

“I’m a feminist,” Andersson said. “This [event] has nothing to do with that. This is not active feminism because feminism is about equality and it’s not very equal to have a race where you exclude the guys. But Thommo said it and I said: ‘Yeah. OK. Fine. Go ahead, I’ll support it.’”

Andersson enjoys coming to Bro Park (“I think it’s going to be really nice”) but expresses a strong preference for English racing. “That’s the country for racing. I know there’s Ireland and Italy and France and the US but it seems like it’s coming from England. It feels like that to me. The traditions and the beautiful tracks you have, the breeding industry ... all of it.”

There is a part of West Sussex that will be forever ABBA, as it turns out. Goodwood is Andersson’s favourite track. Amanda Perrett’s nearby stable is “a wonderful place, amazing ... Even if I hadn’t known her, I’d have said, this is the place to keep a horse.”

The prize money for the very best English races has also been an attraction for the 70-year-old, now a 25-year veteran of the racing game. “I thought, if I have a good horse in training in England, maybe it could pay for 20 years of breeding in Sweden. I’m still on that track...”

Anseanachai Cliste, a nine-year-old chaser at the centre of a possible doping inquiry triggered by events at the Cheltenham Festival on Gold Cup day, remains a possible runner at Perth on Thursday after being withdrawn from two engagements at the same track on Wednesday.

Stephen McConville, who trains Anseanachai Cliste in Portadown, County Armagh, and his son Michael, who has ridden the horse regularly in point-to-point events, have been under investigation by the British Horseracing Authority since the horse was taken out of the Foxhunters’ Chase, the race after the Gold Cup, at Cheltenham on 17 March.

At the time, an official report said only that the stewards had ordered the horse be withdrawn as “they could not be satisfied the horse had been administered only normal feed and water on race day”. More recently, it has been reported that a blood-covered syringe was found in Anseanachai Cliste’s box, and that a subsequent dope test on the horse revealed that it had banned substances in its system.

Anseanachai Cliste won the Ulster National and a first prize of £13,500 just nine days after his withdrawal at Cheltenham, and before the result of the dope test ordered on 17 March had been confirmed. He has also run twice since that victory, at Kelso on 28 May and then at Downpatrick on 18 June, finishing unplaced on both occasions. The gelding was a 33-1 chance for the Foxhunters’ in March prior to his sudden withdrawal, but arrived at the Festival meeting on the back of eight straight victories in point-to-point events between February 2016 and March 2017, for six of which he was ridden by Michael McConville, who is also the nine-year-old’s owner.

It is BHA policy not to comment on ongoing investigations, but if Anseanachai Cliste is declared to run on Thursday, the regulator could come under pressure to use its powers under Rule 83 of the Rules of Racing to refuse to accept the declaration. The Authority used a sub-section of the same rule to prevent Gina Mangan, an inexperienced apprentice jockey, being declared to ride Diore Lia, a rank outsider, in the Derby at Epsom in early June, although the filly was subsequently scratched on the day of the race.

The Cheltenham Festival is jump racing’s showpiece event and the unusual circumstances surrounding Anseanachai Cliste’s withdrawal from this year’s Foxhunters’ will guarantee significant interest in any resulting disciplinary case. If Anseanachai Cliste is found to have been injected with a performance-enhancing substance in his box on 17 March, there could also be questions for the regulators both in Ireland and Britain as to how and why the gelding was allowed to continue racing once the results of the test were known.

Contrary to a report in Tuesday’s Racing Post, which suggested a charge against McConville is “imminent”, it could be several weeks before the outcome of the BHA investigation becomes public.

When contacted by the Guardian on Tuesday, McConville said that he was not able to confirm whether Anseanachai Cliste will be declared to run at Perth on Thursday.

The nine-year-old had two possible engagements at Perth on Wednesday, in the featured £15,000 handicap chase and also in a three-mile handicap hurdle half an hour later, but was withdrawn from both at the overnight stage on Tuesday morning. He is also entered in the £8,000 Mackie’s Cream of the Crop Handicap Chase at Perth on Thursday afternoon.

Players are hitting the ball out of the park at a record setting pace in 2017, yet their achievements are not receiving the attention some would have expected

Baseball is in the midst of a power explosion the likes of which historically has filled stadiums, driven ratings and created a new crop of home run-bashing American sports legends, yet the reaction this time around has been a little more ambivalent.

Yankees rightfielder Roger Maris led the original power explosion in 1961 when he slugged a then-record 61 home runs to pass Babe Ruth’s long-time single season mark. There were 2,717 home runs in baseball that season, which set an all-time MLB mark for 0.95 home runs per game. There was some discussion at the time about whether the ball had been “juiced” – that is, manufactured in order to travel further. But if baseballs were jumping more in 1961 it was not because the ball had made quite the transformation it had undergone in 1911. Back then a new cork-centered ball, as opposed to the rubber core ball of the “dead ball era,” saw scoring (and ticket sales) skyrocket. And so the sudden increase in home runs in 1961 was primarily pinned on the American League expanding by two teams and the subsequent watering down of the pitching talent.

'Maximum tension, minimum release': why baseball produces so many brawls Read more

Home runs didn’t jump again until 26 seasons later in 1987, the year of “the rabbit ball.” Home runs shot up 20% compared to 1986 to 1.06 per game as players like Wade Boggs and Andre Dawson enjoyed power surges well above their career averages and a thin rookie named Mark McGwire blasted 49 home runs for the Oakland A’s. Then power numbers dropped right back down again in 1988. No evidence or study was ever produced to explain the sudden and massive blip, but conventional wisdom said it was juiced baseballs.

Juice of another kind fueled baseball’s next power surge a decade later. With interest in baseball lagging following the work stoppage of 1994 and 1995, a home run chase by Sammy Sosa and McGwire – by then remade into the size and shape of an NFL defensive end – filled stadiums and made baseball the talk of the summer of 1998. Coverage of McGwire’s push to a new record of 70 home runs, four better than Sosa’s final total, dwarfed any other sports news – including the possible destinations of NBA free agents. (Dell Curry, Steph’s father, was a Hornets free agent entering the 1998-99 lockout season!)

The 1998 season averaged 1.04 home runs per game, short of the 1987 record of 1.06, but this time it was no blip. The 11 years between 1996 and 2006 accounted for what were then 10 of the top 11 home run years of all-time, with the 2000 season leading the way behind a whopping 1.17 homers per game. A season later brought Barry Bonds’ remarkable campaign of 73 home runs to break McGwire’s record. No one pinned the dramatic and sustained increase in home runs to juiced balls during this time. The reason was clear (and cream, if you’d like): this was baseball’s steroids era and the drugs were flowing just as many teams debuted parks with smaller outfield dimensions. Even middle infielders were expected to hit 20 or more a year in the sport’s anabolic age.

Then the public decided it was against chemically-enhanced sluggers, baseball instituted tougher testing and penalties for those caught using PEDs and home runs quickly dipped back closer to around an average of one per game, well off the rate of the steroid era. Which brings us to the power explosion of 2017.

Homers are being hit at a rate far greater than ever before in the game’s 114-year history: 1.26 per game. That number would obliterate the current record of 1.17 from 2000, a season smack-dab in the heyday of the steroid era. But the summer sports news isn’t dominated by talk of epic blasts and home run chases like it was in years past. Instead of the latest tape-measure shots from Aaron Judge and Cody Bellinger – young stars most Americans probably haven’t even heard of – it seems more people are talking about NBA forward Gordon Hayward leaving Utah.

Nor has this latest increase in home runs resulted in intense national debate and hand-wringing over the root cause – although the possibility of extra lively baseballs has definitely been discussed inside the sport.

“There’s a lot of people unhappy with the baseball,” the New York Mets pitching coach, Dan Warthen, recently told USA Today. “You’re seeing guys going opposite field, breaking their bats, and the balls are flying out. It’s the balls. They’re throwing harder with it, but they’re getting less movement, so they’re just hanging there. There has got to be some investigation.”

What there won’t be this time is a full-scale congressional investigation like there was in the midst of the steroids era. Few have claimed this latest uptick in power is due to PEDs. And that could very well be true. If steroids have left baseball, year-round weight training has not and muscled men connecting with high 90s fastballs often ends with a baseball in the seats. Or we could be foolishly forgetting (again) that athletes are always able to stay ahead of the testing curve if they really want to.

And while a baseball power surge failing to capture the national consciousness goes against decades of history, it might actually be a good thing. With the added publicity in the past, it was exhausting to see the country analyze and question every upper deck shot. And every pursuit of a baseball power record doesn’t need to result in a national referendum on cheating and ethics. And every failed PED test doesn’t have to be accompanied by a heartfelt discussion with America’s children. (Remember the children?)

“America’s pastime” is that only in history books now, but Major League Baseball is not dying as some would have us believe. The 2016 season boasted paid attendance of more than 73 million, good for 11th all-time. Last October’s World Series brought in the best ratings in 15 years (although that was a lot to do with the Chicago Cubs’ historic victory). And now home runs are up. Way up. Maybe the balls are juiced. Maybe the players are. Maybe no one cares about any of it. The next baseball game you watch will probably have a home run or two or five. Feel free to just enjoy it.

It is at times like this, with a major Test series poised at 1-1 before a decisive finale, that top-level coaches earn their money. On the one hand the British & Irish Lions need no extra motivation for the biggest game of their lives, on the other they must take the field on Saturday with precisely the right mindset. It is part art, part science, particularly in the final week of an 11-month season.

Some head coaches, on the eve of a “cup final”, like to trust in the months of hard training their players have already banked and change nothing. Others come into their own immediately before the biggest occasions, either through gut selections or in how they tweak their team’s preparations. On Lions tours, where the alchemy has to happen quickly or not at all, it helps to have one of the latter sort.

Which brings us to Warren Gatland. His detractors – and he still has a surprising number of them – are overlooking his record when the stakes are at their highest. During his time with Wasps he pretty much patented the trick of squeaking into the play-offs and then blowing sides away on finals day. They won the Premiership title three years on the trot, even wearing bin liners under their training kit before their first success in 2003 to replicate the predicted grand final day heat. When England came to Cardiff for the deciding game of the 2013 Six Nations, with pre-match anticipation levels not dissimilar to this weekend, Wales won 30-3.

On the past two Lions tours of South Africa and Australia, both of which Gatland has been involved in, the touring squad have won the third Tests by the respective scorelines of 28-9 and 41-16. A team who should have been knackered produced some of their best rugby on each occasion. Paul “Bobby” Stridgeon, the strength and conditioning expert who has been a key member of Gatland’s staff at Wasps and Wales, was on both of those tours and is here in New Zealand as well.

A couple of mentally reinvigorating days away from rugby, with the odd beer also permitted, at the end of a long, arduous tour is hardly rocket science. In 2009 the players went on safari and four years ago they spent time in Noosa on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast. Allowing players to go jet-boating and, in some cases, bungee jumping in central Otago on Tuesday was all part of the same pattern and was sanctioned by the medical staff and management.

Two players were advised not to jump because of pre-existing back conditions but Jack Nowell, George Kruis and Taulupe Faletau took the plunge and Stridgeon, who was a wrestler in a previous life, reckons it will refresh the parts another gym session cannot reach: “The boys haven’t had any proper days off, so it’s great to have the boys refreshed. We’ve run this blueprint with Warren a couple of times … whenever we’ve done it we’ve performed well. It’s similar to 2013 when Andy Farrell spoke to the boys after losing the second Test. The boys all wanted to train on the Monday and he made the comment that if we’d done that we’d have played our Test match by Friday. It’s mental refreshment, so we don’t play our game too early.”

We’ve run this blueprint with Warren Gatland a couple of times … whenever we’ve done it we’ve performed well Paul Stridgeon

Meanwhile, the Lions doctor, Eanna Falvey, says all the players who featured in the second Test win in Wellington are available to face the All Blacks. Jared Payne has remained on the North Island after complaining of recurring migraines, although he has been cleared from concussion after the knock he received against the Chiefs on 20 June. “Thankfully all his tests have been good,” Falvey said. “The specialist is quite happy with him. He’ll have a couple more minor tests and that will give us more idea. But while he still has a headache, he won’t be training.”

His Ireland colleague Robbie Henshaw will not play before October after tearing a pectoral muscle off the bone but otherwise Falvey is hoping rest will ease all the minor bumps and bruises. Managing players, he reckons, is best done on a case-by-case basis. “Even in rugby there are Clydesdales and thoroughbreds. Some guys you can send out week in, week out, others, the quicker fast-twitch players, need some time. There’s no one size fits all.”

Assuming everyone’s energy levels are successfully replenished, changes to the starting XV for the final Test are likely to be minimal. There is certainly unlikely to be a shock to match 2013, when Brian O’Driscoll’s omission from the final Test created major waves. One player sure to keep his place is Maro Itoje, whose second Test performance was described as “exceptional” by his Saracens’ colleague Jamie George: “He took himself to a place I’ve never seen before. He showed real maturity and led that pack around. It was brilliant to witness and be a part of.” The Lions hooker also thinks the touring team have made an impact on the locals who, according to one survey, could not name a solitary visiting player prior to the tour. “If we win the series 2-1 I’m sure they’ll know who we are,” George predicted.

Rugby is only a game and New Zealand, as the host nation, remain favourites to secure the series at Eden Park next Saturday. For all those who love the British & Irish Lions, even so, this was an outcome of such exquisite rarity it was tough to recall a more momentous result. Even if the Lions are beaten in Auckland, this tour has already saved one of the sport’s most precious assets for future generations.

To be in a wet, windy Wellington to witness only the second Lions victory in New Zealand in 40 years was also to wonder if Warren Gatland’s supposed impossible mission could yet be accomplished. The lack of preparation, the quality of the opposition, the difficulty of distilling four different quarts into one pint pot: none of it ultimately prevented them beating the All Blacks through tries from Taulupe Faletau and Conor Murray and the nerveless right boot of Owen Farrell.

On top of everything else, there was another quite historic moment. The 25th-minute sending-off of Sonny Bill Williams for a gratuitous shoulder to the head of Anthony Watson really was a collectors’ item; never before has an All Black been sent off in a Test on New Zealand soil and this was only the third time it has occurred anywhere. The last individual to take a walk was ~ “Pine Tree” Meads way back in 1967, which made the decision by the French referee, Jérôme Garcès, all the more ballsy.

Perhaps the home side would have won had Sonny Bill been spared; clearly the Lions were fortunate that Beauden Barrett, who kicked seven penalties, missed three makeable others. But given the historical context, the inclement weather and the screeching pressure on the Lions at 21-14 down with 13 minutes to play, this was as defiant a roar as any visiting side has managed in New Zealand for a while. The last occasion the All Blacks lost on one of their own paddocks was to South Africa in 2009; as well as their 47-Test unbeaten home record, this result has cost them their previous aura of invincibility. It is three years since New Zealand failed to score a try.

It remains 46 years, even so, since they last lost a Lions series. On past form they are absolutely certain to hit back hard next time; the big question is what the Lions have left. The men of ’71 remain legends even now; as the boys of ’17 head to Queenstown for a couple of days of relaxation and recovery, they will know they still have much to do to emulate their predecessors. For all the colossal efforts of Maro Itoje, Alun Wyn Jones, Sam Warburton, Faletau, Johnny Sexton and Farrell, a fully stocked All Black side back on their favourite pitch will be in vengeful mood.

It should also be acknowledged the Lions came close to blowing their grand opportunity, almost fatally undermined by chronic third-quarter indiscipline. A good deal of it appeared to be the product of over-excitement but in all they conceded 13 penalties and had 39% possession. Those are not usually the sort of stats good enough to beat New Zealand and Gatland was not wrong when he suggested his team would have to be better for longer in the decider.

Mako Vunipola will also be glad he saw only yellow for a brutal clear-out of Beauden Barrett, shortly after being warned for a late rush at the same player. The thin line dividing heroes and villains was further reinforced by the crucial final penalty, awarded against Charlie Faumuina for taking out Kyle Sinckler as he jumped to take a pass three minutes from the end. It was a tight call but Garcès applied the letter of the law and Farrell duly dotted the i’s and crossed the t’s.

For all this extraordinary drama to be stitched together in conditions reminiscent of an Alfred Hitchcock shower scene made the tension almost unbearable. It was wet enough in Wellington not just for gumboots but a mask and snorkel and the Lions, despite their increased physicality and sense of purpose, could not cling on to the ball long enough to make massive attacking inroads.

Ironically, it was a loose pass thrown by Faletau and scooped up by Watson that ended up landing the onrushing Williams in the soup, forcing the All Blacks to sacrifice the flanker Jerome Kaino and bring on the debutant Ngani Laumape. They also suffered from Barrett’s inaccuracy off the tee while Farrell, by contrast, kicked an utterly outstanding penalty through the monsoon to help ensure the visitors were level at 9-9 at the interval.

The third quarter, though, belonged entirely to New Zealand as the Lions’ composure began to fray. It was going to require something more accurate, different or more incisive to change the course of the game and it duly arrived on the hour. The Lions finally made ground inside the All Black half through Watson and when the ball was transferred back down the line there was enough room for Liam Williams to send his Welsh team-mate Faletau powering into the left corner.

When Murray, following a break from Jamie George, scored a second try with 11 minutes left and Farrell’s conversion levelled the scores at 21-21, the finale was almost too tense for either set of supporters to bear.

When it was finally all over there was one slightly off-key moment when Sinckler and TJ Perenara had to be repeatedly separated, with the pair’s disagreement still festering during the post-match guard of honour.

In every other respect, though, this was a rhapsody in red and sets up the most eagerly awaited Lions Test in the professional era. In Australia, Gatland’s 2013 side saved the best until last, hammering the Wallabies 41-16 in Sydney. Even a one-point win four years on would be the finest achievement of these players’ rugby lives.

The Durham fast bowler is set to make his first Test appearance since 2015 against South Africa and is eager to revive an England career stalled by injuries

“I got my cap out of the drawer for the first time the other day and it all came back,” says Mark Wood, the Durham fast bowler who, after an 18-month absence from Test cricket, is back in the England squad for their series opener with South Africa at Lord’s on Thursday.

“It’s still a bit grubby – I haven’t washed it, I like it with a bit of dirt on it – but looking at it and the number 667 made me think about the good times before and the excitement of facing another country in Test cricket. Hopefully, if I get selected this week, I can add a few more memories to it.”

England show some surprising caution at the start of the Joe Root era Read more

That Wood – the point of difference in Joe Root’s attack with his ability to bowl 90mph from a skiddy trajectory – is buzzing and desperate to add to the eight Test caps and 25 wickets he picked up in 2015 is understandable, having exclusively played limited-overs cricket for his country since the first of three ankle operations late that year.

His pace, fitness and wicket-taking ability were all demonstrated during the Champions Trophy – a subject at which he still recoils given the painful semi-final defeat by eventual winners Pakistan. Now the 27-year-old is fully focused on the red ball, and the job he can perform in the slipstream of new ball stalwarts Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad.

“I want to be a bowler that can be a game changer,” says Wood. “Either through a spell or a just a single wicket that can break open an end or change a session.

“It’s great to be back playing with Jimmy and Broady – they are invaluable. They’re always talking to you out in the middle and make it much easier for the bowlers that come on after them. They give very little away, so the job is to keep up the pressure. If guys then go to take you on, there’s a chance for a wicket.”

That Wood’s return has gone under the radar is in part down to other more eyebrow-raising selections, such as Gary Ballance’s recall or the surprise spot for Liam Dawson. But it also shows how highly thought of he remains, such that his name felt a formality when Root and the selectors announced their plans for South Africa over the weekend.

Wood sees it differently, claiming that were it not for the side strain to Chris Woakes he may not have got a look-in. With Jake Ball also missing through a knee problem, Ben Stokes managing something similar and Anderson and Broad on the way back from respective groin and heel issues, there is a certain irony that Wood looks the sturdiest.

“I wouldn’t say that but I’m feeling fit and ready to go,” says Wood. “The other day my name came up on Sky Sports on a list of injured fast bowlers and I thought, ‘hang on, I’m fit!’ I suppose if you’re guessing about injuries to England fast bowlers my name would naturally pop up, but the ankle is holding up. The England physios, Craig de Weymann especially, have been fantastic.”

The other day, my name came up on TV in a list of injured fast bowlers. I thought, 'hang on, I'm fit!'

This summer is not exactly fast bowler-friendly, , however, with seven Tests in a little over eight weeks making it almost inevitable there will be rest and rotation for the stable of quicks, which also features the uncapped Toby Roland‑Jones. Having missed around three-quarters of England’s matches since his debut two years ago, Wood is both keen to play every game but accepts that may not be possible.

The difference this summer, he claims, is rotation will be done to manage his workload rather than him being patched up to get through a Test in the first place. His thoughts are instead about the South African batting lineup that, while missing AB de Villiers, still has some stardust.

Asked who he is looking forward to bowling to in this series, Wood replies: “Hashim Amla. I’m targeting anything that isn’t the middle of his bat. That’s what most of the balls I bowled to him during the one-day series seem to hit. So an edge would be nice.

“ Quinton de Kock is obviously a class player. [Durham team-mate] Keaton Jennings has been giving me some tips on how to get him out, saying that the best way is a half-volley hit to cover after he got him that way for the Lions on Saturday. I’m not sure if he’s winding me up …”

It would not be out of keeping with England’s three-man Durham enclave, among whom Stokes is now deputy to Root. “When we played [against Worcestershire] last week Ben kept being hit to third man and was getting angrier and angrier. We kept reminding him of his responsibilities as an England vice-captain.

“But he’s a guy who is a natural leader – he just drags people along with him. Rooty is a very good thinker on the game and speaks so well. It’s an exciting time to back amongst it.”

England are not the only side under new leadership, with South Africa announcing on Monday that their captain, Faf du Plessis, will rejoin the squad shortly following the birth of his first child last week – but not in time for Lord’s. Dean Elgar, the opener, will deputise in his absence.

Prop Tadhg Furlong is among the Lions who faced the All Blacks for Ireland last year and knows the physical battle they must win to make history in Auckland

It is cold and clear in beautiful central Otago, the home of bungee jumping, fruit orchards and fine wine making. The British and Irish Lions are starting their week at leisure in jet boats, off-road vehicles and helicopters but the most important night of their rugby lives is fast approaching. By the time they transfer back up to Auckland they need to be fully focused on the All Blacks and, specifically, how to beat them twice in a row.

Winning a Wimbledon final against Roger Federer in his heyday or shooting 63 in the final round to win the Open at Royal Birkdale would be simpler than defeating the All Blacks in a series-defining Test in Auckland where the home side have not lost in 23 years. The good news for the Lions is that Saturday’s 24-21 victory over New Zealand has given them a shot at one of the game’s ultimate prizes.

It will take a seriously committed performance but, of the two sides, it is the Lions who arguably have more improvement left in them. Putting aside Sonny Bill Williams’s red card, the try count in the series currently stands at 4-3 to the Lions and, assuming they have any energy left, the visiting forwards now know New Zealand’s pack is not invincible. If they can ramp up the necessary intensity once more, then who knows?

The snag is that the All Blacks have been here before. If anyone has first-hand experience of the backlash heading the tourists’ way, it is the squad’s Irish contingent. Ireland beat New Zealand for the first time in Chicago last November before being outmuscled in Dublin two weeks later. Players like Tadhg Furlong, the Lions’ Irish tighthead prop, do not need telling that an awful lot can change in a week.

Furlong has clear memories of the Dublin rematch, when the All Blacks took the most direct route to redemption available. “I remember coming off the pitch and being absolutely shattered … I was sore for days after it,” recalled Furlong, a fixture in the Lions’ front row for all the biggest games on this tour.

“It was one of the most brutal Test matches I’ve played in my short career. I think everyone will expect that and try and tee themselves up for it.”

In Furlong’s view, there is no great mystery to what the All Blacks will bring. “They’re probably in a similar position as we were the week just gone, where your pride is a little bit dented. It’s a Test series, they’re going to be absolutely bulling for it, as we were. You just have to be ready with your detail and be physically and emotionally at that pitch that you can compete and go toe to toe.”

This is where things get really interesting. This is not just any old game for the Lions, either. The word immortality might sound pompous to contemporary ears, but New Zealand have only ever been beaten once in a Lions series. “There’s one game left in the season and it’s probably the biggest Test match in any of our squad’s lives,” said Furlong, who has now beaten New Zealand twice in a Test career that began less than two years ago.

“You always fear the All Blacks in the sense that if you don’t get your stuff sorted, if you don’t man up and meet them head on head, it’s a tough day at the office. They’ll cut you to ribbons in the wider channels if you give them space. You have to keep attacking them but that is easier said than done. They’re just so damn consistent and good at holding on to the ball. They’re a tough team to beat.”

The onus, then, is on the Lions to be more disciplined than they were in the 20 minutes after half-time in Wellington. Furlong confirms words were exchanged but, for a variety of reasons, the message did not get through. “There was a period in the second half which was really, really frustrating,” the 24-year-old said.

“It seemed like we kept on giving away penalty after penalty and putting ourselves under pressure, which is something we have to rectify if we want to be competitive in the third Test. Another day, with maybe better weather and a few of their kicks going over, and it would have been a different scoreline.”

Watching from the sidelines will be the Furlong family, who have shared their boy’s ascent from New Ross RFC in deepest County Wexford. His dairy farmer father James famously does not carry a mobile phone and is not a frequent flyer.

“Dad spent 14 hours looking at how far the plane had gone. My mother said he actually watched that thing for the whole time, seeing if it would jump on a bit. He wouldn’t watch a movie or anything. He’s in good spirits and I think he’s happy to be off out at the minute bombing around. Mixing and mingling is probably what he does best.”

His son is made of similarly old-school stuff and is looking forward to renewing acquaintance with the All Blacks loose-head Joe Moody. “I don’t think they’ll massively change what they’re doing. They’ll try to physically come back at us which is the same in pretty much every Test match.” For New Zealand, either way, the final Furlong will be far from routine.

• Coach cautions against winding up New Zealand before decisive third Test • ‘Hopefully the wounded Lion from last week is still recovering as well’

Warren Gatland says his British & Irish Lions players can go on and win the series after their dramatic 24-21 success against New Zealand in the second Test. The Lions head coach is wary, nevertheless, of a ferocious response from the All Blacks on Saturday, acknowledging the Lions have “poked the bear” with their victory in Wellington.

The Lions have transferred to the south island for a couple of days’ relaxation and recuperation but are confident they can improve further in the decisive third Test in Auckland. “Yes, we have poked the bear but hopefully the wounded Lion from last week is still recovering as well,” said Gatland, suitably encouraged by the evidence of the first two Tests.

Sean O’Brien cleared for Lions decider while Williams gets four-week ban Read more

“This is the best team in the world and, for two Test matches, they really haven’t stressed us. They have squeezed us and made us give away penalties but we haven’t seen the expansive rugby that the ABs are known for. We’ve coped with that and, if we can continue to improve in other areas, then we are going to see, hopefully, a great Test match.”

The Lions will have Sean O’Brien, who is free to play after escaping a ban having being cited for an alleged swinging arm to the head of Waisake Naholo, and Gatland feels the Lions now have some genuine momentum. “Saturday was pretty massive for all of us: for the future of the Lions, for the team, for everyone involved; to go 1-1 with no one expecting that. Now [we can] go to Eden Park thinking: ‘Actually, if we put our best foot forward and play to our ability, we are capable of winning that Test match and the series.’”

Gatland, even so, is demanding better discipline and an improved kicking game compared with the second Test, in which New Zealand were reduced to 14 men following the first-half dismissal of Sonny Bill Williams. “There were a lot of things I wasn’t happy about,” Gatland said. “I wasn’t happy about some of the penalties and the discipline. I am happy we got ourselves out of a hole and showed some real character and courage and I am happy with our physicality but we’ve got to make sure we don’t give away stupid and soft penalties. Key players were guilty of that.”

The head coach, a proud Kiwi himself, will also advise the squad that winding up the All Blacks in the build-up to the big game is not a good idea. “They love that. They don’t often get the opportunity to have pressure put on them and, when they do, they thrive on it. Hopefully we don’t give them any ammunition this week and concentrate on ourselves because they will be using anything they can to motivate themselves.”

The All Blacks will have to do without Williams, banned for four weeks for striking Anthony Watson’s head with his shoulder, but the Lions assistant coach Graham Rowntree has defended Mako Vunipola, who was sent to the sin‑bin for a heavy challenge on Beauden Barrett. “Mako’s a physical player but he’s not a dirty player,” Rowntree said.

Gatland also says his players will not get carried away and misbehave on their short break in Queenstown. “I don’t envisage that being an issue whatsoever. These players are true professionals; they’ll have a couple of quiet beers. On the last two tours we’ve gone away somewhere, freshened them up and had a couple of light sessions later in the week. That’s worked really well for us and hopefully it’ll do that again. We’ll talk to the medics and the conditioners and then start thinking about the team.”

Alun Wyn Jones, who led the Lions in the decisive third Test victory against Australia in Sydney four years ago, also reckons a brief period of rest is key. “We know the intensity, given what’s at stake, will go up again like it did four years ago and you imagine very little will change,” the Welsh lock forward said. “I’ve made the point we need to enjoy our victory and then get ready for next week.”

Petra Kvitova produced the most stirring moment of Wimbledon’s opening day, beating Johanna Larsson in straight sets on Centre Court to confirm both her own status as an improbable candidate for a third women’s title and another step in a heartening comeback story.

Petra Kvitova could return to tennis within six months following knife attack Read more

Seven months ago all four fingers on Kvitova’s left hand – her tennis hand – were lacerated by the blade of a knife carried by an intruder at her home in the Czech Republic. Kvitova still has not regained full strength in her grip. Before the tournament she was still wondering if her serve and her forehand might improve as the fortnight goes on and her fingers get stronger. The idea of playing seven high intensity matches in a fortnight sounds less like rehabilitation, more like an unremitting punishment for severed and healing tendons.

And yet Kvitova is now comfortably through to the second round, producing a performance here that was initially rusty but which thrummed up through the gears and showcased some lusty hitting. She was watched from the players’ box by her family and also by her surgeon, the entire Kvitova camp wearing T-shirts with the slogan “Courage, belief, love”. By the end a 6-3, 6-4 victory contained only one moment of uncertainty as Kvitova seemed to run out of gas a little midway through the second set. Larsson broke back to take it to 4-4 but was then reeled in by the class and power of Kvitova’s groundstrokes.

The match was closed out to a wash of fond applause for a popular former champion who really might not have been back here had the knife cut a little deeper last December. The attack itself was both horrific and a little bizarre in its details. Kvitova was having breakfast when a man rang the doorbell claiming to be there to read the electricity meter. The man entered her home and attacked her with a knife, causing serious injury as she fought him off. Kvitova’s attacker fled with the equivalent of £150, although the incident has reportedly been reclassified by local police as a blackmail attempt.

Kvitova was visibly relieved just to play a completed match at a tournament she said gave her the motivation to work through the pain of rehabilitation. “I felt real energy from the crowd and it was amazing to be back here playing on Centre Court again,” she said. “I’m very happy that the dream came true.”

For all that, this still looked like a slightly tender workout for a player feeling her way back, one who will need to enact an unusual balance between recuperation and stretching her way into match-playing fitness. A late decision to enter the French Open in May led to Kvitova winning her first match back but losing her second. At the end of last month she won on grass in Birmingham. Now she is, improbably, one of the bookmakers’ favourites to win Wimbledon, tribute to both her own champion history and also to the love of the tennis public for a comeback tale that represents a triumph of will and spirit.

At the end the royal box stood to applaud both players off as Kvitova signed autographs with a notably careful grip of the marker pen, designed perhaps not to take too much out of those convalescent fingers. Before these Championships she had announced that her first game here would be her own final. A little rusty, a little down on match-play, but with no weight on her shoulders, Kvitova has the chance of six more now – not to mention an outsider’s shot at one of the great and greatly improbable Wimbledon stories.

• Surgeon says operation on tendon and nerve damage a success • Spokesman: ‘The end of her career did not even cross her mind’

Petra Kvitova could return to tennis within six months following a knife attack that could have been career-ending and which the two-times Wimbledon champion admitted had her fearing for her life.

Doctors optimistic Petra Kvitova will play tennis again after knife attack Read more

Radek Kebrle, the surgeon who operated on the world No11, said on Wednesday afternoon the operation to repair tendons and nerves in her left hand – her main playing hand – went “very well, with no complications”. A spokesman for the player earlier said: “The end of her career did not even cross her mind.”

Kebrle added: “Petra will be on bed-rest for 14 days, she will begin slow rehabilitation at around six to eight weeks post-operation. If that rehabilitation process goes well, Petra should be able to grip a racket for the first time [but not play tennis] at three months.

“The best case scenario is Petra will be able to return to the court after six months. It is too soon to specify when precisely she can return to competition but Petra is ready to do everything she can to get back competing at the highest level. Petra is happy with how the operation went and is in good spirits.”

Kvitova’s manager, Katie Spellman, earlier tweeted: “Petra has undergone surgery for three hours and 45 minutes. Considering the extent of the damage, the surgery went very well. Doctors repaired damage to tendons in all five digits of the left hand, as well as two nerves. Petra will wear a cast on her hand for six to eight weeks and will be unable to bear weight for three months.”

Separately, a spokesman for the Czech Federation Cup team told local television Kvitova was focused on resuming training and playing, however long her recovery may take. Karel Tejkal, her spokesman, added: “She kept saying: ‘Let them put me together fast, no matter if it takes months or years.’ She is looking forward to training again.”

It seems inconceivable the 26-year-old could return to the Tour before Wimbledon, the major where she made her breakthrough in 2011, and where she won again in 2014. Given the severity of the injuries and the length of the operation, it seems certain she will face a long period of rehabilitation before beginning even light practice.

“The start of 2017 won’t be the same without her unique power and competitive spirit,” the WTA said, reflecting the shock caused by at the assault on one of the game’s most popular players.

The attacker gained entry to Kvitova’s building in Prostejov, Czech Republic, posing as a worker reading utility meters and was unaware who the occupant was until he was inside the front door of her flat. He forced her into her bathroom holding a knife to her throat and in the ensuing struggle slashed deep knife wounds to the four fingers and thumb on her left hand. He fled and she called the police before being taken to hospital.

The player remained upbeat in a posting on Facebook on Tuesday. “Today I was attacked in my apartment by an individual with a knife. In my attempt to defend myself, I was badly injured on my left hand. I am shaken, but fortunate to be alive. The injury is severe and I will need to see specialists, but if you know anything about me I am strong and I will fight this. Thank you all again for your love and support and now I would appreciate some privacy while I focus on my recovery.”

Kvitova was already in doubt for the Australian Open in January because of a foot injury that flared towards the end of one of her toughest seasons. She began the year ranked No6 in the world and tumbled out of the top 10 for the first time since 2013. She changed coaches twice and separated from her long-time fiance, the Czech ice hockey player Radek Meidl.

If you were at Hyde Park in London over the weekend, you could have gone to see Phil Collins or Justin Bieber. On Thursday the Kings of Leon are on. But on Tuesday, 4 July, you will find the first truly committed steps towards introducing baseball to the UK.

A two-year runup to regular season competitive games being played on this side of the Atlantic has already begun but the first major event in that cycle will take place from the Hyde Park stage. At ‘MLB Battlegrounds’ the England cricketers Jos Buttler and Alex Hales, along with retired Major League Baseball players Carlos Pena, Shawn Green and Cliff Floyd, will take part in a ‘home run derby’: for the uninitiated, this means they will try to hit the ball as far as possible, as often as possible, against the clock.

Baseball in Hyde Park? MLB wants to stage games in Europe in 2019 Read more

Planning for regular season games in Europe, currently pencilled in for 2019, is still at a very early stage. No teams have yet committed, although plenty have shown an interest. A venue has still to be confirmed but the Olympic Stadium looks most likely.

But MLB UK has grander ambitions aside from simply promoting isolated novelty events. Baseball has flirted with this country before: exhibition tours took place at the end of the 1800s and early decades of the 1900s, and in 1993 some minor league teams played games at The Oval. Regular season MLB games have also taken place around the world, in Mexico, Puerto Rico, Japan and Australia.

But just as the NFL and NBA regularly bring competitive games to these shores, so MLB wants to gain a foothold in Europe, which leads to the obvious question: how do you introduce baseball, a sport which has little history or cultural relevance in the UK, to a sporting consciousness that already has plenty to occupy itself with?

“The biggest problem in many respects is that we’re a sport with 150 years of tradition that has a really deep-rooted place in American culture,” says Charlie Hill, managing director of MLB UK. “It has a place and is understood and has all these rules and ways it behaves. The biggest challenge is making sure you don’t assume you can take it as is, to assume it will be exactly the same as in America.” The challenge is how to make that fit into the British sporting landscape.

‘Battlegrounds’ is an early attempt to do that, to introduce a version of the sport to a new audience – a soft introduction, perhaps. It is gimmicky and relies to some extent on the novelty of already famous cricketers playing an unfamiliar sport.

But more is going on too. A few months ago initial steps towards involving and cultivating UK-based fans were made, including a consultation group and working with bloggers and the podcast Batflips And Nerds, the idea being to help create more of a community. Then came various schemes such as a regular web show presented by the long-time baseball follower ~ Murray, social media campaigns run by a company called Engage, who have worked with Manchester City and the RFU, and a virtual reality game currently installed at Pop Brixton in south London. More is planned and at the moment things are at the experimental, “let’s see what sticks” stage. Ultimately the idea is to build an audience gradually for not only 2019 but beyond.

Baseball probably has more layers than most sports, and they can be idiosyncratic and wonderful Charlie Hill

Yet there are a number of obstacles to overcome, not least that baseball can be a sport of labyrinthine complexities, arcane conventions and unwritten rules. How to make sense of, for example, the idea that among players it is considered acceptable to throw a rock-hard baseball at 100mph deliberately at a player’s torso if he isdeemed to have celebrated excessively? Or the intricacies of baseball terminology: a balk, a bunt, an eephus? Or the often impenetrable stats used to assess a player’s performance?

The short answer to the question of how to explain all of this is: don’t. Or at least not straightaway. “When you sit someone down and try to educate people, it’s a very hard thing to do,” says Hill. “You learn a lot by just watching. We don’t have to provide a rulebook for everybody. I think what’s true to most sports, particularly baseball, is that they can be enjoyed in layers. Baseball probably has more layers than most and they can be idiosyncratic and wonderful. Initially we’ll have an open mind about what layers are ‘hooks’ and get people interested.”

Marketing is another issue. A problem that baseball in America suffers from is a lack of cultural crossover stars - basically players everyone has heard of whether they åre interested in sport or not. Most people know who Cristiano Ronaldo or LeBron James is but baseball’s best players – Mike Trout, Kris Bryant, Bryce Harper, Mookie Betts – are relatively anonymous in the wider public consciousness. This might be changing gradually but the ESPN reporter Buster Olney recently speculated that the most famous baseball player in America is David Ross, runner-up in the last series of the American version of Strictly Come Dancing.

Again, the quick answer to that problem is to ignore the lack of outstanding individual personalities and concentrate on what baseball does have. “I think the stars of our sport are actually the teams,” says Hill. “I don’t mean the squad of players but, if you take something like the New York Yankees logo, that transcends sport. It’s iconic of not only baseball but the city of New York. You ask most people in any country who aren’t aware of baseball at all, they’ll tell you, ‘That’s New York.’” Or to put it another way, baseball already has brands that people recognise but do not necessarily associate with the sport. Making that connection should not be especially hard.

It is probably a better way of ensuring the sport has some longevity, too: individual stars are transient but the teams – the biggest teams at least – are not. Try to sell a slice of wholesome Americana, rather than one player. “Sports like football have the problems of how to market themselves to families,” says Hill. “But we’re already a family sport.”

The logistical problems of actually playing games thousands of miles away are worth considering, too. MLB teams play a minimum of 162 games a season and thus their schedules are packed. Days off are rare and so teams will be unable to follow the NFL route of spending a week in London, mugging for the TV cameras and getting acclimatised. Finding time in the calendar for a couple of transatlantic flights is tricky but not impossible. “We don’t see a problem with the travel,” says Chris Park, of MLB in the US. “We have already played games in Japan and Australia and the excitement of playing baseball in another part of the world is something most players look forward to.”

While American football and basketball have had a presence in the UK for quite a few years, there is almost no point in comparing notes: those sports, and the experience of watching them, are so different from baseball that there is little value in trying to copy what they have done. A more apposite comparison is probably Twenty20 cricket, which has similar rhythms, takes a similar amount of time and is also a sport with great traditions being introduced to a new audience. “Twenty20 took plenty of its ideas from baseball,” says Liam Carroll, head coach of the Great Britain baseball team. “It just shows what an exciting sport this can be.”

Another way in which baseball can help embed itself in this country is through greater participation. The plan is that watching games will help encourage people to play, not least because baseball players often do not look like typical athletes, and differ wildly. Two of the most exciting young players in the game are José Altuve, Houston Astros’ second baseman, and Aaron Judge, a New York Yankees outfielder: the latter is 6ft 7in and built like a back-row forward, the former 5ft 6in and might look more at home on a horse – the “if you see it, you can be it” principle, applied to sport. “A Major League game in London is the biggest thing we can hope for to expose our sport to more people,” says Carroll, whose organisation is separate from MLB UK but has a “very positive” relationship with it.

The UK represents a blank slate for baseball and gives an opportunity to create something new. A whole sport can be packaged and sold in a completely different way, using its traditions but not being held back by them. “We’re trying to establish a deeper connection rather than just being a novelty,” says Hill. As much as anything the next two years will be a fascinating experiment in how, given the right time and opportunity, what is essentially a brand new sport can be introduced to this country.

Aaron Smith is impatient to avenge the second Test defeat but Steve Hansen will appreciate the time he has to find the right combination to tighten his defence

Around 10 minutes into Aaron Smith’s press conference, it suddenly became obvious that this was the very last place he wanted to be. It is not that Smith particularly dislikes journalists, faced any awkward questions, or had anything he was trying to hide, it is just that he was so keen for the weekend to come around. All he and his team-mates want to do now is get out on the pitch and try to put right what went wrong last Saturday. “I could play today, that’s how ready I am, I’m ready to go right now,” Smith said. “I just want to get to the end of the week, let’s get into it.”

Smith’s team-mate Brodie Retallick, sitting alongside, nodded his head. “It’d be good to go to Saturday right now,” Retallick said, “and not have to worry about the rest of the week.”

Five key issues ahead of decider between New Zealand and the Lions | Paul Rees Read more

Steve Hansen, on the other hand, will be glad to have a little time in which to work. He has a few different problems to deal with this week. Like the way his team lost control of the second Test and the fact that they did not stress the Lions’ defence. He also has to figure out what to do with the All Blacks’ midfield now that Sonny Bill Williams has been banned for four weeks. Ryan Crotty, who started outside Williams in the first Test, is still recovering from the hamstring injury he sustained in that game.

Crotty has been doing some training with the team but it would be a surprise if he was fit to start. The doctors reckoned it would be between two and four weeks before he was ready to play again.

With Crotty and Williams out, Hansen has to find the best combination between Anton Lienert-Brown, Ngani Laumape, Jack Goodhue and Malakai Fekitoa, who was called up to the squad on Sunday. They have only 36 caps between them. Goodhue, 22, is one of the brightest young prospects around but has not made his debut yet. And this match, the biggest played in New Zealand since the World Cup final in 2011, is no place for a rookie.

Laumape gave a little reminder of that when he won his first cap last weekend. He came on after Williams was sent off, and good as he is with the ball in hand – a bee-stung elephant would be easier to stop – he made a crucial mistake.

It was Laumape who rushed up to close down Owen Farrell in the 69th minute, which left a large gap for Jamie George to burst through in the runup to Conor Murray’s try. Watch it again and you see that Johnny Sexton knew exactly what Laumupe was doing, which is why he put George through. Given that the Lions will surely play Sexton and Farrell together again this weekend, Hansen may well want to pick a midfield with a little more defensive nous about it. Which is where Fekitoa comes in. Lienert-Brown can play at both inside and outside centre, so he may move across to No12 and allow Fekitoa to start outside him.

Lions beat New Zealand on tiniest of margins, and a thrilling finale awaits | Nick Evans Read more

Smith, who plays with Fekitoa at the Highlanders, describes him as “a very physical player, very confrontational” who is “very good on our defence” and “will go hard and do his job really well”. He gave a brilliant defensive performance in midfield when the Highlanders beat the Lions a fortnight ago. Fekitoa also, and Smith thinks this will help him, has “a bit of a chip on his shoulder”. He has won 23 caps for the All Blacks, but was dropped from the squad before this series. That decision led to a lot of speculation that he was about to quit the country to go play for Toulon in France. Midi Olympique reported that he was about to sign a two-year deal, something Fekitoa’s agent has denied. Now he’s back, he has a point to prove.

Fekitoa and Lienert-Brown is the most experienced combination Hansen has to hand. They have started three Tests together, the last of them, and this is key, the return match against Ireland in Dublin last November, a fortnight after the All Blacks lost in Chicago. There has been a lot of talk about that game lately, since it was the last time New Zealand had to play a second game against a team who beat them. But the All Blacks keep knocking back the comparison. “We definitely want to do it a bit differently to that second game against Ireland after Chicago,” Smith said. “We turned up with all the fight but didn’t perform as well as we wanted to.” The way he talks you would never guess they won 21-9.

Hansen believes the defeat in Chicago was because the All Blacks had a problem with their attitude. “While we had a couple of the big boys out, and won 18 on the row, we got to Chicago, a big sigh of relief after getting the record, and we may well have been starting to get comfortable.

“The Cubs had won the World Series the first time in however many years it was and we’d started to become tourists rather than a team on tour.”

Last Saturday “was totally different”, he said. “It wasn’t an attitude problem. It was that we were one short and we were playing a good side.”

If this week’s problem is a different one, Hansen will still hope the fixes he comes up with are just as effective.

Club’s failure to buy three tunnels beneath the Nursery end in 1999 have caused a problem which will not go away

With the great weekend of the summer at cricket’s HQ – the Test against South Africa – imminent, several hundred members of the Marylebone Cricket Club gathered in the pavilion the other night. They were not, however, discussing the match but an issue which, unknown to most cricket followers, is causing far more worry at Lord’s than the state of England’s batting order.

They met not in the Lord’s pavilion, the grand and famous Victorian one, but in something called the Nursery Pavilion, which is a prefab – hardly more than a glorified marquee – hard up against the forbidding brown-grey brick “prison wall” that separates the sacred home of cricket from the busy Wellington Road.

It has to be a prefab. MCC cannot dig down here, not even to plant a rose bush. They have not merely lost their old role as masters of the cricketing universe, they do not control all the earth beneath their feet. And that was the point of the meeting: a chance to resolve a problem that dates back to the 19th century.

MCC get into swing of day-nighters and pink balls before the England Tests Read more

The current dispute began just before the last millennium and, given that it involves a 999-year lease, it may not be resolved until the next one. For the last 18 years has produced one of the most bizarre and bitter disputes in sport, so vicious that Sir John Major – used only to the genteel ways of Westminster – stalked off the committee in disgust.

And though the details are only patchily understood, even by the club’s own members, the continued existence of Lord’s as a major cricket venue could be at stake.

The threat is not yet as urgent as it was at the very start: 1890, when what became the Great Central Railway attempted to get a compulsory purchase order on Lord’s to run its trains in and out of Marylebone station. It was huge news at the time: a Punch cartoon showed WG Grace on horseback, leading out an army of bat-wielding cricketers to confront an approaching steam engine.

Eventually a deal was done and the railway acquired a 124ft-wide strip of land under the eastern edge of Lord’s to run its trains in three tunnels. MCC outlasted the Great Central, which fell to the Beeching axe in 1966, although one of the tunnels is still in use running what are now Chiltern trains.

In 1999 Railtrack, the short-lived company that owned all Britain’s track after privatisation, decided to sell off the redundant tunnels, and offered Lord’s a 999-year lease. The club faffed around. So there was an auction instead: MCC bid, but half-heartedly and, at £2.35m, the lease – and the right to develop the tunnels – was sold to a property company, the Rifkind Levy Partnership.

Oliver Stocken, a well-known City figure and later MCC’s chairman, told me the club could not then afford the tunnels. This is hard to believe. And no one was more staggered by the club’s reluctance than the man who was then chief executive of Railtrack, Gerald Corbett. Of whom more later.

Is the club there primarily for cricket or for its members? No one really knows

The Great Central was an ambitious company. And the tunnels below Lord’s are not to be confused with Tube lines or sewers: they form a breathtaking space, with innumerable possible uses. It is not clear that even now MCC has realised the potential, below ground as well as above. But it knew right away it was a disaster and it knew who was to blame: not itself for blowing a once‑in‑a‑millennium opportunity, but Charles Rifkind, the man who outbid it. How dare he?

Rifkind lives in St John’s Wood. He passed the prison wall daily, was appalled by the keep-out message it sent passersby and saw the potential. He is a property developer: of course he sniffed money. But it was more than that. The ground over the tunnels was dead space, and he sensed something could be made of it. He assumed MCC would get that too, to mutual benefit.

Instead, for seven years, the club sulked. Then in 2006 MCC appointed an outsider as chief executive, the Australian Keith Bradshaw. He met Rifkind; they got on. And from that arose an elaborate plan called The Vision, involving much new digging for a wholesale renewal of the ground. It was pushed forward by a development committee including Sir John Major and both Mike Atherton and David Gower. It also gave MCC a £100m windfall in return for about 140 flats in place of the dreaded wall.

However, this scheme came up against an ever bigger wall in the shape of Stocken, who had become club chairman in 2009. Stocken insisted the plan was impractical and risky, on which point he was probably right; in that sense he might have saved the club. But his methods of getting his own way caused enormous affront: he dissolved the development committee and imposed another, packed with placemen. Major walked out; Rifkind was again frozen out.

MCC has positioned itself in recent years as a moral exemplar to the game (“The Spirit of Cricket”), which makes it fortunate that outsiders know little of its opaque workings. It is not a democracy: almost half the committee and all the major office-holders are appointed not elected. Nor is it much of a club. There is little camaraderie or common purpose. Is the club there primarily for cricket or for its members? No one really knows.

The vast majority of those members come in via a waiting list that now stretches to 27 years: the average age is over 60. Most are anxious to make the most of their hard-won prestige and access. And provided the committee does nothing to prejudice that, they do as they are told. The annual meetings are sometimes contentious, but arguments are invariably settled by an obedient postal vote.

Towards the end of his term, Stocken shored up his power by re-introducing the long-lost system of “starring” preferred candidates for the elected half of the committee. It worked. But there are also a growing number of livelier members, who gravitate towards the unofficial Online Pavilion website.

This helped prevent any notion of Stocken securing his own succession. And in 2015 a new chairman emerged, from MCC’s secretive but in this case seemingly fair machinations. His name was Gerald Corbett, an obscure backbencher in MCC terms but the man who as boss of Railtrack had sold the tunnels in the first place.

He was, as usual, presented to the membership like a medieval monarch cradling his new man-child to the populace. But Corbett is a more genial figure than Stocken, with greater regard for the niceties. He set about trying to settle the Rifkind business once and for all.

Hence the meeting in the prefab, the last of five “roadshows” – two in London, three in the provinces, just like an Ashes series – presenting two competing development schemes to the members: either a revamped version of MCC’s own piecemeal “Masterplan”, which ignores the contentious strip except to move the Nursery Ground closer to the prison wall; or the latest iteration of Rifkind’s alternative, making use of the disputed territory to include two blocks containing 97 flats – now more discreetly placed on the corners – and offering £150m in direct payment and assorted sweeteners. No compromises: one or the other.

It requires a particular kind of genius to own 17 acres in St John’s Wood and not have made an impregnable pile of money

The precise breakdown of the payment is almost certainly irrelevant because it ain’t going to happen. With the consultations ended, the committee is expected to make a recommendation in late July to be ratified by the members in September. The committee is believed to be almost unanimously against Rifkind.

And the first floor-speaker in the prefab set the tone for the evening: “Residential development at Lord’s, the Home of Cricket? Never! Never! Never!” A former committee man put it more suavely: “We’ve been in business for 200 years … I think we can continue and move slowly forward.”

The Rifkind camp thinks it may have got a draw at the meeting in Bristol, but accepts that it got walloped in the other four matches. Most ballots are unpredictable these days. Not at Lord’s, though.

The debate has undoubtedly been fairer than anything permitted by Stocken. But Rifkind and Morley were not allowed to present their case to the meetings, merely to answer questions. And the document, sent to all members, reviewing both options was clearly, if subtly, skewed, in favour of MCC’s plans; the interlopers were forced to hand out their own brochure outside the gates. On the field, MCC has always been reluctant to doctor its wickets in the home team’s favour. This is a harsher game.

Rifkind’s offer does have something the club cannot match: a thick layer of futureproofing. MCC’s plans depend heavily on Lord’s continuing to host two Test matches a year – which is uncertain even in the very short-term and certainly not beyond that – and on the planned new city-based Twenty20 tournament.

Lord’s also has to cope with council-imposed restrictions on both floodlights and non-cricketing earners like rock concerts. Soon it is likely to be relegated to London’s third-biggest cricket venue, behind the ambitious Oval and the Olympic Stadium. The risk is that it becomes an agreeably quaint relic, an urban Arundel; and, in due course, genuinely hard-up. It requires a particular kind of genius to own 17 acres in St John’s Wood and not have made an impregnable pile of money from the 50-year property boom.

In the meantime the members will delight in the impending defeat of the evil forces of Mammon, although not for the first time MCC may be misreading Rifkind. If this was ever about money for him, that ceased long ago. He could and probably should have just shrugged and moved on to a less contentious site. But he is quite clearly obsessed. He is also very resourceful; with him there is always a Plan B, C or Z.

The Masterplan includes the prettification of the internal side of the prison wall by tree-planting. In pots, to avoid the 18-inch restriction. The other side of the wall is likely to be unchanged. MCC has never worried too much what face it presents to the outside world.

A curious thing happened in our corner of south east London last month. Normally quiet side streets were rammed with double parked cars, the babble of excited young fans with accents from around the country filled the air and the sold out signs went up at The Valley for the first time in many years.

Since the absentee owner Roland Duchâtelet began his one man war against Charlton Athletic’s fanbase, it has often been hard to tell when there is a home match in SE7 as a dispirited, desperate and dwindling band continue their estimable protest against an owner who has hollowed out their proud club.

Hashtag United, Wimbly Womblys and the virtual gamers striking it rich Read more

But these hordes of youthful and giddy fans were wearing not the red of Charlton but the black and white replica shirts of Sidemen FC – an online phenomenon who were to play a team of YouTube Allstars in a charity match.

As just the latest iteration of a dizzying set of developments that have left those of us who find the prospect of watching clips of other people playing the video game Fifa as baffling as parents of the 1950s found a Chuck Berry 45, it was a sign that something is shifting.

There is a palpable nervousness among television executives, expensively attired sporting executives and the concentric circles of advisers and analysts that populate the industry that something may be happening beyond their immediate vision.

Television ratings for live sport, the rights fees for which have for so long been the engine that has powered the growth of sport in the modern era, are down. The Olympics, once seen as the pinnacle of sport but now tainted by cynicism, are struggling to attract a younger audience.

Play Video 11:23 ESports: the digital revolution has arrived – video

Meanwhile interest in the likes of the Sidemen and Spencer FC, a gang of Sunday League footballers that reach audiences of 2m plus on YouTube for their matches in an imaginary league, is up.

Rather like the swirl of the current political climate, there is a sense in which the combination of changes in media consumption and the sporting landscape have led to a youthful thirst for forms of sport and entertainment that the mainstream has been slow to pick up on.

Perhaps it should be no surprise that as the old places where the young carved out an identity away from their parents – football grounds and concert arenas – have become the overpriced domain of their elders, they should seek out new ways of defining themselves against previous generations and find these virtual spaces where they can gather, play and posture.

It is these shifting tectonic plates that the Guardian’s Sport 2.0 series, which grew out of a series of four documentaries conceived by our award winning sports photographer Tom Jenkins, has this week tried to track.

As ever, future gazing is an inexact science. In trying to predict the future it is impossible to escape the whiff of those much parodied black and white documentaries that predicted we would all be travelling to work in hovercrafts.

And yet, just because we cannot tell where any of these trends are leading it does not mean that we should not try to identify them. Our series of films and articles – from drone racing and driverless F1 to the debate over whether video gaming is a sport, from the concept of watching holographic players beamed in from the other side of the world to the challenges facing traditional formats to maintain an audience – have raised more questions than answers.

They go beyond the old pub argument of what makes a sport, and challenge long held assumptions. Perhaps it is no coincidence that they have played out against the backdrop of a continual drip feed of ennui-inducing news from traditional sport – most recently from British Cycling.

As Jenkins and writer Simon Hattenstone proved in their final dispatch from South Korea , the dystopian dark side of e-gaming does not suggest that new forms of sport will be any less prey to malevolent forces.

Amid concerns over grassroots sport and participation, the prospect of a generation bathed in the glow of screens can seem depressing.

Yet there is hope here too. The kids playing Fifa, following Spencer FC or worshipping at the digital altar of a Neymar avatar then practising their party tricks in the park are just as in thrall to football as their parents who were hooked in through yellowing programmes and Jimmy Hill.

It is hard to see where all this is all ultimately headed. But what is not in doubt is that the old order is changing and those sports that do not remain curious enough to at least ask the questions will eventually wither and die.

If you had been away from the planet for the past quarter of a century, one of the few things you might find comfortingly familiar on your return is the world of sport. While the digital revolution has transformed the way we shop, chat, date, do politics and consume culture, sport looks largely unchanged. From football to cricket to golf, it’s still the same old staples, hitting a ball into a hole or goal or over a boundary. There hasn’t been a major new sport invented for more than a century. Or has there?

In the East End of London, Sam Mathews is holding court at Fnatic’s HQ, otherwise known as the Bunkr. A pop-up shop that opened last December, it is marketed as the “world’s first eSports concept store” and is as knowingly hip as its Shoreditch surroundings. Here at the Bunkr, you can buy eSports equipment, meet players, view streamed events and even watch matches live.

ESports consist of a variety of video games, for which you need nimble fingers and a fast brain to succeed. Just as with traditional sports, fans follow teams, watch matches and even attend cup finals, cheering on their favourite stars from around the world. Mathews founded Fnatic 13 years ago, with financial support from his mother, and has built it into one of the world’s most successful teams, competing in more than 600 tournaments globally, in games such as Counter-Strike, Dota2, Call Of Duty, Overwatch and League of Legends. Fnatic’s League of Legends team won the first world championship in 2011 and its Counter-Strike team are considered one of the best of all time, though few of the players are British. In truth, British players are not yet good enough to compete at the top level. “eSport is the first world sport outside of football that is truly global,” Mathews says.

Already, football clubs such as Manchester City have started signing Fifa stars who are players of the virtual game, rather than the real thing. The most ambitious clubs, such as Paris Saint-Germain, have signed up a whole squad of players in a number of different eSports, including League of Legends. The thinking is simple: digital gaming is where the next generation of fans will come from (often, a young person’s first interaction with a professional football club is through the Fifa game), and so eSports are a vast reservoir of future income.

The revenue from eSports is expected to rise from $130m (£100m) in 2012 to $465m (£365m) this year, according to Newzoo, the eSports data expert. The global audience will reach 385 million this year, made up of 191 million regular viewers and a further 194 million occasional viewers. ESports stars such as the South Korean player Faker, who has just turned 21, are already paid up to £2m a year, and that’s not including bonuses and sponsorship. But will they ever compete with, say, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo? And should we be worried if they do?

Poland’s eSports ‘Olympics’

The vast Spodec stadium in Katowice, south west Poland, is humming with activity. It is February, and this saucer-shaped building is host to the world’s biggest eSports event. Thousands of boys and young men (nearly everyone is male) gather to watch the Intel Extreme Masters finals, a kind of annual Olympics.

It is much more than a tournament. The halls are crammed with companies showing off their latest wares; visitors can try out new games on elevated seats that revolve 360 degrees. The noise is deafening – constant explosions and the rat-at-at-at of guns – while the screens light up with every new kill. You wouldn’t come here to find peace.

The professional eSports companies and players come here to make big bucks, while sponsors attend in the hope of tapping into tomorrow’s market. (Britain hosts its equivalent at Wembley Arena, but it is small fry by comparison.) The Fnatic team is competing against the top Korean, American and European teams. Fnatic might be British-based, but it is regarded as a global company; few British players are good enough to compete at the top level.

This is the fifth year the Intel finals have been held in Katowice. Once a weekend-long event, it now takes place over two weekends. This year’s figures are record-breaking: 173,500 attending, more than 46 million viewers watching online (up 35% from last year).

The event is the most widely broadcasted in the history of ESL, the eSports company that organises competitions worldwide. In 2015, Swedish media company Modern Times Group acquired a majority stake in ESL for $87m. That figure already looks like a bargain. ESL broadcasts its competitions on Twitch, the leading eSports streaming service. In 2014, only three years after it was founded, Twitch was bought by Amazon for $970m. Another bargain: this is a huge business.

What has astonished people – even those who dreamed it up in the first place – is the extent to which gaming has become a spectator sport. ESL founder Ralph Reichart blinks in disbelief at the thousands of young men staring at screens inside the Spodec. “We thought, let’s just build this stage and it’s going to be great.” He smiles. He didn’t expect it to be this great. “Most people thought we were crazy, including my father and my peers.”

The Intel Masters was founded in 2006, and Reichart puts its growth down to four factors: social media, live streaming, a faster internet, and the longevity of more established games. There is something fantastical about the way Katowice, this redundant mining town barely 30 miles from Auschwitz, has become an emblem of tomorrow’s world. Reichart explains how it happened. “Five years ago, the mayor contacted us. He said, ‘We have a fantastic stadium called Spodec, and our city is changing. It used to be all mining, and now we want it to become an entertainment city – video games can help’.” Nowadays, Katowice is largely known for the Intel masters, which Reichart calls the Woodstock of eSports. “Some music festivals are more special and longer-lasting than others, and Katowice is like that. It’s more than a festival - it’s a movement.”





Seoul searching

If you want to get to the heart of gaming, you don’t go to Poland – you go to South Korea, the cradle of eSports. It’s Friday night in Seoul and I’m spending it the way many Korean youngsters do: at a PC bang. PC bangs are gaming cafes and by 9pm this one is packed. Many of the youngsters here will play through the night. The hundreds of computer screens are all busy. Most people are playing the hugely complex League of Legends; some, simpler shoot-’em-ups such as Counter-Strike; others are playing Fifa. You can buy energy food and drinks, cooked meals, alcohol, and there is a smoking room. You can spend as long as you like without ever needing to leave.



The teenagers and twentysomethings are too absorbed in their games to chat to each other. However, some play team games that involve talking animatedly to strangers in different parts of the world. PC bangs were initially opened by the South Korean government, keen to promote the internet and gaming. Apart from taekwondo, South Korea did not have a national sport and eSports presented an area in which they could excel (the country has one of the fastest and most developed broadband networks in the world). Today, PC bangs are not only cafes; they are the parks and playgrounds of South Korea.

Jeong Hyeon-seok is an impressive young man, a 28-year-old maths teacher who is about to leave for the United States to do a PhD in brain science. He comes here three or four times a week, staying for two to four hours each time; occasionally, he stays overnight. Jeong says it’s cheap compared with other forms of entertainment and exhilarating. Like many men, he says, he is reserved and awkward in conversation, but here he feels happy, uninhibited.

He is not embarrassed about visiting PC bangs but he does not tell his father where he goes. It’s a generational thing, he explains. “The older generation think of eSports and gaming as something that people who have failed would do to waste their time. Parents would expect you to do something productive; to study.”

Why is there such a high proportion of male to female players? “Girls prefer chit-chatting in a coffee shop. Boys don’t do much chit-chatting,” Jeong says. Playing a team game at a bang provides a release. He can hook up with strangers and share a common goal: defeating the enemy. Jeong is transformed when he starts playing Overwatch, a team game that involves transferring goods to different areas and, of course, killing. He speaks fast and excitably, barking instructions to anonymous team-mates. When he finishes, he looks exhausted and is out of breath. Does he feel good? “Yes. You feel good if you’ve won a football match. It’s like that.”

Schooling future superstars

Sport 2.0: crumbling traditions create a whole new ballgame | Sean Ingle Read more

Ahyeon polytechnic high school is the equivalent of a sixth-form college and takes students who have struggled in the mainstream. When the principal, Bang Seung-ho, realised many students were bunking off because they had spent all night playing games, he took radical action: he opened a PC bang in the school. So long as students studied regular subjects in the morning, they could play eSports to their hearts’ content in the afternoon and evening.

Bang, a charismatic man who could pass as a film star, believed having a PC bang on tap would prove an incentive for students to attend school. And so it did. The students were transformed. “It was incredible to see how good their attitudes towards the classes became,” he says. “Once you embraced those kids, recognising what they are good at, their mentality changed. They started studying as well.”

Bang became something of a star in the process. He had always considered himself a singer-songwriter, sidetracked from his destiny, so he wrote a song about eSports addiction. Don’t Worry became a hit in South Korea.

Meanwhile, at his school, the youngsters became better and better at games as they trained with a talented peer group. Before long, Bang realised the school was becoming a training ground for future professionals.

He takes me to the PC bang where the students (all boys) are too absorbed to look up. How many want to become professionals? Now they look up. Everybody raises their hand instantly. How many hours a day do they need to dedicate to games to succeed? The very minimum, they agree, is 10 hours a day. So far, seven or eight of Bang’s students have turned professional. “I always say: ‘You have to give me a percentage of your earnings,’ but they never do!” He grins.

Bang does not like to use the word addiction for problem users; he prefers overindulgence. I ask if he would rather be remembered for curing overindulgence or for creating eSports stars. “Both. The school can cure the students and train them to become a professional beyond the cure.” But if he had to choose one? For once, Bang is lost for words. Finally, he answers: “If I really have to choose between curing and training to become a professional, it would be the latter.”

‘It cannot be good for your health’



The Sangam eSports stadium in Seoul looks like a cross between a cinema and a conventional sports stadium. One of the biggest eSports teams, SK Telecom (owned by the telecoms operator), is playing a qualifying League of Legends match, and I can’t hear myself think for explosions. The huge screen is a dizzying array of electric pinks, blues, purples and yellows. League of Legends fans tell me it took them months to understand it: it’s a strategy game set in a fantasy arena with three or five players on each side, which involves destroying towers and killing opponents, but there is no obvious way to distinguish the two teams. I cannot tell who is attacking whom, though the neon scoreboard keeps me abreast of what is happening. The crowd is young and more than 50% female. This is surprising, because League of Legends, like all eSports, is male-dominated.

Most of the girls are here to see Faker, SK Telecom’s star mid-laner (status-wise, the equivalent of a central midfielder in football). The team has the appeal of a boy band. Faker is not only SK Telecom’s leading player, he is the biggest star in League of Legends, full stop. Even I can tell he has something special about him; he tends to score and assist with more kills than other players. But there is something else: he is deceptive, subtle, appearing out of nowhere to strike with a swirling flourish. The crowd roars and claps him on. He may be a superstar, but he looks like most eSports players: bespectacled, spotty, exhausted and pasty-faced. You sense he may not have seen the sun for years.

I follow Faker past the crowds of selfie-chasing girls to a private room. He wears a stylish red and white jacket with his nickname inscribed on the back in capital letters (his real name is Lee Sang-hyeok: “I thought Faker sounded cool,” he says). He is a sweet and sombre young man, determined to answer every question as fully as he can.

I ask whether it is his reaction speed that makes him such a good player. “No. Actually, my reaction velocity isn’t so good. What’s more important is concentration.” In some ways, he says, League of Legends is like chess or the abstract strategy board game Go, but in others it resembles traditional team sport games. “It is like football and basketball, in that strategies become more important than individual skills as you go to a professional level.”

Faker enjoys his fame. He recently went to Seattle and began to understand the scale of his success when he was recognised in the streets. That gave him a buzz, he says. Is it true he will only marry a girl who is as good at League of Legends as he is? He smiles. “What I said about my ideal woman was a joke, but people actually believe it now, which makes me worry about my future.”

How many hours a day does he put into League of Legends? “I practise a minimum of 12 hours a day. Sometimes 15 hours a day when it’s close to a match.” Does he get bored? “I am still enjoying it but probably not as much as I was before I became a professional. Yes, I do, I get a bit bored.” But, he says, that is a small quibble. He knows how lucky he is.

Does Faker think of himself as a sportsman? “You don’t always have to use your physical mobility in sport,” he says. “So, to that extent, I think it’s a sport – apart from the perception that eSports damages your health.”

Is that a fair perception? “As you sit for long hours without much movement, inevitably it cannot be good for your health, but I do believe it contributes to brain development.”

It’s 10pm and the world’s leading League of Legends player has to return to the team house. When I get back to my hotel, I turn on my television. The first channel I flick to is showing today’s SK Telecom match. There are endless replays, analysis of Faker’s form, interviews with the players. Suddenly, the scale of League of Legends hits me. This channel shows eSports for 24 hours a day. I am watching South Korea’s Match of the Day.

Death by a thousand games

It has not been easy to get time with the chairman of the Korean eSports Association. Jun Byung-hun is a busy man. He is also the chairman of the International eSports Federation – possibly the most important man in this world. Finally we meet at his office in Seoul. He is wearing a smart black suit and shoes you can see your reflection in.

Jun’s ambition is to make eSports as popular worldwide as they are in South Korea, and he sees little standing in his way. “Older people think games poison the youth and take time from their studies, but this is wrong,” he says. “It is like stopping the flow of a river. The support policy should be to help the water not to flood, and lead them in the right paths. By doing so, we can maximise the effectiveness of the regulations.”

In truth, Jun is not a big fan of regulation. In 2011, the Korean government acknowledged the country had a problem with young people addicted to gaming and introduced the Cinderella law, which forbids children under the age of 16 from playing computer games between midnight and 6am. Jun is contemptuous of it. “The Cinderella law is anachronistic. I’ve been vigorously campaigning to eradicate it. Games should be established as a leisure culture within family. Trying to restrict them creates bigger side-effects.” He looks at his watch. His minders say he has to leave.

Before he does, I ask if eSports should be in the Olympics. “Yes, of course. It should have the same status as sport.” For the chairman, it is not a question of if, but when: eSports will be included in the official programme of the 2022 Asian Games. “In the digital era, eSports will not just be established as a major sport, but also the most beloved sport.”

At the National Centre for Mental Health in Seoul, Dr Lee Tae-kyung knows exactly why the government introduced the Cinderella law. Lee is in charge of the addiction department at the government-run psychiatric hospital. He used to deal mainly with drug and alcohol addiction but today it’s all about gaming. Problems typically emerge, he says, when children enter middle school, at the age of 11. They lose interest in academic work, friends and family; they stop sleeping; they eat poorly or hardly at all. “There was a young man who immersed himself without sleeping or having meals, and finally he died after finishing his game,” Lee says. “People asked whether we should ban internet gaming or restrict players’ times after this case. But the harsh regulations depress the industry.”

Does he think the government is doing enough to tackle addiction? “No. I support the Cinderella law but it is not enough.” He describes the industry’s lack of support for addicts as “immoral”.

Lee treats his patients with a programme he has created called Hora, after a character in Momo, a fantasy novel written by the German author Michael Ende in the 1970s. Momo is about an eponymous girl whose life is ruined by the arrival of a species of paranormal parasites that steal time from humans. Momo and the human race are eventually rescued by their saviour, Hora, who returns time to them. For Lee, the story of Momo is the perfect metaphor.

Choi is an addict and an inpatient at Lee’s hospital. He is 31 but seems younger. He talks gently and movingly about how his addiction alienated him from the real world and his job assisting an interior designer. He says he played at PC bangs for four to six hours every night, and stopped eating properly.

Did his habit affect the quality of his work? “Very much. My work could be quite dangerous, because some of the materials are very sharp and need special attention, but I was feeling so sleepy, the designer was worried about me.”

He says he began to confuse his own identity with characters in the games he played. He stopped relating to people. At the hospital, he has undergone music and poetry therapy. Choi talks about a particular poem that has had a profound effect on him, in which the poet sends a letter to a loved one on a lettuce leaf. He smiles as he thinks about it. “When I was playing games in which I was only killing, breaking, attacking, I was not really living, not thinking about my family. I realised it would be beautiful if I could return to normal life.”

Choi has no intention of giving up games but he hopes when he leaves the hospital he will be able to play in moderation. Lee’s conservative literary therapy seems effective but he is not overly optimistic. “Choi is in remission but the temptation will always be there.”

Other therapies are more radical. The Easy Brain Center in downtown Gangnam is a private clinic, apparently modelled on easyJet; it even uses a similar orange and white motif. This is where desperate parents with money bring their children when they have run out of hope.

Dr Kim Hyun-soo is less formally dressed than doctors at the government-run hospital. He talks about how patterns of addiction have changed in South Korea. “In the 1990s, the addiction issues were associated with glue or gas. In 1998, internet games were commercialised, and in 2000 I started seeing gaming addicts. Many of the glue and gas sniffers moved on to gaming. Since then, the top-ranked addiction among young people is game addiction and 90% of the addicts are male teenagers.”

Kim has a kindly face and a gentle laugh that belies some of the terrible stories he tells. He talks about the addicts he has seen who wear nappies so they don’t have to leave their game to go to the toilet; the gamers so obsessed that they stop eating and sleeping altogether. And then there are the horror stories, those that made the news all over the world. He says he was one of the psychiatrists on a committee that investigated the case of a games-addicted young man who killed his mother before killing himself. “There have been many tragic social cases that are related to game addiction.”

One case that particularly affected him involved a 23-year-old addict whom Kim successfully weaned off eSports in 2005. “I treated him for six months and thought he was cured.” But he killed himself two months after completion of the treatment. “We realised he had wanted to keep the relationship with his gaming friends but he was chucked out of that community. The fact that he thought he had lost all his social relationships led to his suicide.” It was a painful lesson for Kim. “I realised it wasn’t a simple issue of not playing the game at all – it’s not black and white. I had to go much deeper into the psyche.” He discovered there were different types of gaming addictions: some people were addicted to moving up the ranks; some to the money-making aspect; and some to that sense of belonging to the gaming community.

Those addicted to the money side, he says, are most difficult to treat. Gambling in eSports already seems more advanced than in traditional sports. Professional players have been banned for betting on themselves to win matches or, more commonly, to lose. Last year, one of the biggest names in Starcraft, Lee “Life” Seung-hyun, was imprisoned after being convicted of match-fixing. He has been banned for life from eSports in South Korea.

Kim says younger and younger people are becoming addicted. He has seen six-year-olds refusing to go to school because they are addicted to smartphone games. He treats his patients with “talking therapy”: addicts talk out their problems and hopefully reach a solution. If they are addicted to the competitive element, Kim may suggest an analogue sport that would suit them; if they play because they are lonely, he may suggest they join a small community less prone to addiction. It is a moderate approach to treating addiction.

I ask if he will give me the most powerful shock he gives patients. The impact is violent. I still feel it hours later

But that is only half the story. Next door, his partner, Dr Lee Jae-won, sits in a room full of terrifying, hi-tech gadgetry. When talking does not work for youngsters, he turns to electric shock treatment. One machine delivers basic shocks to stimulate the frontal lobe; the other provides transcranial magnetic stimulation, a less brutal therapy. These treatments, particularly the first, are controversial, especially when used on young people. But Lee insists his treatment is much more sophisticated than the crude electroconvulsive therapy of yesteryear. As he talks, he regularly flicks a switch, gives himself an electric shock and twitches. He seems unaware that he is doing it.

How old are the youngest people he treats? “There are kids who are obsessed before they enrol in their elementary school. With gaming, it is the frontal lobe that degenerates. And it is the frontal lobe that makes humans act like humans. So having it damaged makes them antisocial, impulsive and unhappy.” The electric shock stimulates the frontal lobe, he explains.

I ask if the brain zap is random. Yes, he says, but it does not matter. “If one part of the brain is stimulated, the surroundings will get stimulated accordingly, too.”

I ask if he will give me the most powerful shock he gives patients, on my hand. It’s only a single zap, but the impact is violent. My bones resonate as if struck by a tuning fork. I can still feel it hours later. These shocks are meant to be applied to the head.

On the way out, I see a little boy, possibly nine years old, in the waiting room with his mother. The boy has a League of Legends tattoo on his arm. This is a cultural taboo in Korea, where tattooing is illegal, and a clear sign the boy is far gone. I wonder whether he will get the talking therapy, electric shock or both. This is the flipside to the glamorous world of Faker, the packed out stadiums, the fans and the multimillion-pound deals.

Policing the opportunists

Ian Smith, the British first head of the eSports Integrity Commission (Esic), says it is the wild west out there. The world of eSports is exciting, largely unregulated and ripe for exploitation. It’s his job to make sure things don’t get out of hand. Smith, the former legal director of the Professional Cricketers’ Association, has plenty of experience of dealing with corruption, not least spot- and match-fixing.

In eSports, cheating is relatively easy, he says. You can slow opponents down using technology that messes with their internet connection, or take drugs to speed yourself up. Or you can simply lose. And it is becoming increasingly susceptible to corruption, because so many people are betting on matches. The casinos in Las Vegas are now streaming matches to attract young people. In March, Esic signed a memorandum with the Nevada Gaming Control Board to share information about suspicious betting patterns. Next year, the Luxor hotel will become home to the first eSports arena on the Las Vegas strip.

Smith wants eSports to benefit from the lessons learned in other sports: “We can save time and bypass the pain,” he says, “because traditional sport has already gone through this. You will get guys riding it, coming in and looking at the money. They are already doing it. The industry can say, we don’t want Fifa, we don’t want Sepp Blatter, a bunch of corrupt old men telling us what to do and making millions off us. But what do they want? At the moment, they have no idea.”

Is the industry supportive of his ethics code? “I have been accused more than once of building a highway for cars that don’t yet exist. The trouble is, I know the cars are coming, because I’ve spent 20 years looking at them. People want to wait until they’re run over by that car.”

In Britain, we are just starting out on the eSports road. Traditional sport still dominates, yet every day new evidence emerges of change. BT Sport is broadcasting the Fifa 17 Ultimate Team Championship Series in the UK for the first time this year. Last month, Tottenham Hotspur announced their new ground will host live eSports matches, with potential crowds of 50,000 and revenues of £3m a match.

While the London Olympics were intended to “inspire a generation” to play sport, it has emerged the number of people playing traditional sport or exercising at least once a week in the UK has dropped 0.4% since 2012, to 15.8 million. In March, a YouGov poll revealed 91% of parents said their children did not get the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity a day. They worry their children are lost in sedentary, virtual worlds. Korea’s problems may seem a world away but it is already seven years since the UK’s first eSports addiction clinic opened, in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. British therapists may prefer a 12-step programme to electric shock treatment but who knows what the future holds?

What exactly are eSports and just how fast are they growing? In our final Sport 2.0 film, we ask why thousands of people have begun to attend eSport events across the globe and look at how problems such as corruption and cheating may affect sport’s digital counterpart just as much as they do in the real world

Emphasis on simulator work in motor sport means more drivers will emerge from the gaming scene – if they can conquer problems over the lack of ‘fear of death’

When Lewis Hamilton looked to his future in Formula One in 2012 and decided to leave McLaren, the team with whom he had grown up and won his first world championship, the decision was roundly questioned. After securing two further titles for Mercedes, the move was regarded as inspired but predicting what is round the corner in motor racing has never been easy and, with F1 having just begun the process of reinvention under its new owners, the future is very much on the agenda.

Many sports have faced new challenges and opportunities because of the extraordinary changes technological advances have wrought in the past two decades. But that is true of F1 perhaps more than most, the sport having stuck with a long outdated model that has increasingly failed to engage with a younger audience. If F1 and motor racing in general are to survive, doing so is crucial and it seems it is at the crossroads between the virtual world and the real that it is most likely to happen.

Playing the role of seer in this game is tricky but one trend has been difficult to ignore – the rise of eSports. Several weeks ago McLaren announced their World’s Fastest Gamer programme – an annual competition in which video gamers will compete to win a job as a simulator driver for the team.

The team’s executive director, Zak Brown, has made it clear that eSport will be part of the team’s racing efforts in future and they will stand in the vanguard of what may develop into part of every team’s portfolio. It is a good marketing exercise, of course, but also valuable in its own right. “The F1 audience is getting older and this is part of how we capture the younger generation,” he says. “This is how that generation will grow up learning about the sport.”

It is the tip of the iceberg. Last month MotoGP announced it would launch an eSport championship this year, a multiyear project with the stated aim of becoming “the most important racing eSport championship”.

Equally this weekend the greatest sports car race in the world, the Le Mans 24 Hours, will also host the final of the third season of the Xbox-based Forza racing championship. This, the largest racing eSports event yet to be held, has been identified by the organisers of Le Mans as an area for expansion, having created an official endurance eSports category.

“We’re inventing a new form of motor sport that speaks to a younger generation,” Dan Greenawalt, the creative director of the Forza games, says. “Our goal isn’t to mirror or shadow real-world motor sport as it exists today. We want to take the relevance, authenticity and physicality of real‑world motor sport and blend it with the approachability, strategy and interactivity of today’s major eSports.”

Dismissing this as still just the stuff of teens in their bedrooms looks hopelessly naive. In April it was announced that professional gaming will be an official medal sport in the 2022 Asian Games and Staffordshire University recently declared it would launch the UK’s first degree in eSports in September 2018.

The numbers back both decisions. Professional gaming has a growing fanbase, with a global audience not far short of 400 million, worth a revenue projected to be into the billions in three years’ time.

Sport 2.0: crumbling traditions create a whole new ballgame | Sean Ingle Read more

This is not being driven by motor racing gaming – with the majority of eSports based around strategy or first‑person shooter games. But that such a potential market exists is why so many are eager to become part if it. Red Bull and Michelin are already on board with the MotoGP project as sponsors, where the aim for the moment is communication – encouraging people to follow the sport – rather than making money.

This crossover between the real and virtual has not appeared out of the blue, however. Jann Mardenborough won the PlayStation Academy programme in 2011. The competition to take gamers and give them a shot in a real car in partnership with Nissan was hugely successful and he embraced it. The British driver has since taken a class podium at Le Mans and raced in GP3 and is currently a factory driver for Nissan in the highly competitive Super GT series in Japan. He is sure the two worlds will become closer.

“In professional motor sport today there is a lot of emphasis on simulator work and I can absolutely see that in the future more and more professional drivers will emerge from gaming,” Mardenborough says. “When Nissan first came up with the opportunity, lots of people thought they were mad. I think now nearly 10 years later we’ve proved that the concept works.”

Like Mardenborough another British racer, Graham Carroll, moved into driving sims when the money ran out to pursue his career on the track. In January he competed in an eSports competition in Las Vegas with a $1m prize and is convinced greater involvement from teams is only a matter of time. “It would just add to the show if there was a Formula One sim race,” he says. “It is just getting bigger and bigger. If someone is signed to a proper racing team there will be knock-on effect and lots of people will be signed up.”

For the next generation of drivers such as the prodigious British talent Lando Norris, the 17-year-old who was signed to McLaren’s young driver programme in February, the line between the two forms of racing has never really existed. “Lando Norris is on the simulator every single night with us,” Carroll says. “People wonder why he is so good – he is in a car at the weekends but every single night he is on the simulator.”

There is a way to go yet, however. Racing remains a minority arena for eSports and the developer of the MotoGP game admits it is a field hard to make compelling to watch.

Equally, they must work on the problem of races becoming dead rubbers because players crash out more often, a consequence of there being no “fear of death”, but they are confident these things will be solved. The near future seems only to promise greater involvement and, if it engages a new fanbase, it will be to the benefit of all forms of racing.

But there may also be a case of back to the future in the long term. A return to motor racing’s original purpose – to test and promote cars in order to sell them –may also come to play a role.

Ross Brawn, who is overseeing F1’s reinvention, has already noted of his plans: “If we say Formula One has to align itself with road cars, then logically we end up with an electric car that drives itself – and nobody wants that in Formula One.” He is right but that has not prevented the emergence of just such a series.

It is the basic premise behind Roborace, which uses a single make of car where the emphasis is on the artificial intelligence used to pilot the autonomous vehicles. The series is currently partnered with Formula E and set to appear at FE races in future. With self-driving cars on the cards for consumers, racing is the perfect way to prove their capabilities.

Bryn Balcombe, chief technology officer of Roborace and an engineer who worked for Formula One Management for 16 years, believes the series’ genuine road relevance will be key. “If a car can win a race on a Sunday, wouldn’t you want it driving you around on a Monday?” he says. “It is a shift in the industry that is happening and it is using motor sport to accelerate and promote that shift.”

The proving ground of racing offers an opportunity for manufacturers who are looking to be able to offer drivers of the future a varied set of personalities to choose from for their autonomous cars. Indeed, Ford have already patented a race car mode as one of the personalities for their future autonomous vehicles.

It is still early days and hard details of when and who will participate in the series remain unconfirmed.

There is interest from manufacturers and racing teams but perhaps the greatest question mark here is whether fans would take to following the “personalities” of differing AIs. Whatever the outcome, change is coming to the sport in the short and long term and that, as Hamilton proved, can have the most intriguing results.

It's not about the money, more a rites of passage in the form of making a break from the team that has been his life

Away from the numbers, away from the domination of digits and dollar signs, away from the cold, hard diktat that compels sportsmen to make career decisions based on immediate financial gain – endlessly consulting their magic eightball agents, away from the disingenuous and the downright deceitful manoeuvring that precedes new contracts everywhere, sometimes a decision is based on more than lucre. Thus, although "money" is the word publicly connecting McLaren to Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton's move between them, it seems only fair to also acknowledge that in this case there may have been an all too human rationale in the driving seat as well.

In Formula One, numbers are all. They are both the goal (to finish first) and central to the means by which it is achieved (the quest to go faster), as well as the grease that keeps the whole infernal difference engine furiously spinning (those dollars, those digits, again). In the paddock they are held in a fetishistic reverence that eightball-wielding agents would admire and they are the mechanics with which the personal in the sport is so often subsumed.

But it is there nonetheless. Last year, when Hamilton took pole in Korea, it was the first time Red Bull had been knocked off the top spot. Yet he was outwardly unmoved and appeared indifferent at best. After a hard race, driving brilliantly to hold off a charging Mark Webber to take second place, he seemed even grimmer.

"I've had the worst year, if you expect me to be all happy-doolally after a race like that you're not going to hear it," he responded to inquires as to why he was not taking more pleasure in a fine drive.

A difficult year it had been, the championship was gone and his team-mate, Jenson Button, was beating him on points, but his reaction still appeared out of character. Soon afterwards his split with girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger was revealed and it all seemed to make sense.

He was going through a difficult period in public, a man of 26 dealing with emotions that most people endure repeatedly in private, while much younger and with the freedom to really let go, bury themselves, perhaps, in a bottle of cider and a Joy Division album, to emerge all the better, several weeks later.

Hamilton, in contrast, grew up in a much more controlled environment. He had an extraordinarily advantageous start to his career that could not have been better in terms of becoming a successful driver but as everyone in the more chaotic, ordinary world knows, there comes a point when it is just time to strike out on your own.

McLaren signed him to their young driver programme when he was 13 and he has been part of the team ever since, taking an F1 seat in 2007. In motor racing terms they are his family, with all that the concept entails. They have nurtured and protected him, revelled in his successes and comforted his failures but also had demands on and control of, much of his behaviour and his time.

Proving to oneself that you are in control of your destiny is so very much a given rite of passage that it is almost unnoticeable. Hamilton has had to do it in public and in the form of finally making the break with the team that has been his life.

John Watson, who drove for McLaren between 1979 and 1983, believes that this need to develop and assert himself away from the team was a central tenet of his decision. "It's like a kid growing up and leaving home, getting away from the parental control," he says. "When you become a McLaren driver everything about you becomes, in effect, the property of the team. McLaren are a great team to drive for but they've got limitations and I think Lewis felt those limitations were intruding into the time that he wanted to develop, from a non-motor racing perspective.

"Because he came in so young he doesn't know anything differently. Jenson is a more rounded personality and character by virtue of life experiences. Lewis's life experiences are very much contained within the strictures of McLaren."

Money would have been a factor but Watson believes that far more important is what the Mercedes team principal, Ross Brawn, has told Hamilton to expect from their new car – certainly the manufacturer will expect to be strong in 2014 when the new engine rules are introduced. But these are the intangibles debated over the previous weeks of will-he won't-he debate. What seems more concrete is that Hamilton wanted to grow and develop and to do so he simply had to move on.

"Principally, I think the kid just wants to be his own person. Whatever he perceives as a burden, he's shed that now," is Watson's verdict on the first step of what he sees as a longer journey. "I would love to see Ross, Lewis and I go fishing," he says. "Show Lewis that there are other qualities or values in life that are very simple. I'd love to see Lewis with a mayfly trying to catch a trout. He's won grands prix, he won a world championship but he'd find it a lot more difficult to catch a trout. It's all about life balance."

Whether the move delivers for Hamilton, the driver, is yet to be seen but he seems to have made it as much for Hamilton, the person, a man who is looking at the numbers and trying to make them balance.

After the ecstatic Lewis Hamilton took the chequered flag on Sunday he performed donut spins for the cheering crowd while Daft Punk’s “One More Time” blared out from the Mercedes garage. As he crossed the line and had it confirmed that he had equalled his idol Ayrton Senna with his third F1 world title, the 30-year-old said over the car radio: “This is the greatest moment of my life.”

A little later tears mixed with sprayed champagne. Beside Hamilton and his beaten team-mate Nico Rosberg and Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel on the podium there was Sir Elton John. It is not often that he looks upstaged.

Lewis Hamilton ‘overwhelmed’ after winning third F1 world championship Read more

This was a chaotic, compelling race. There were two safety cars, two virtual safety cars, crashes and enough all-round action to fill half-a-dozen grand prix weekends. How the Americans loved the show.

Hamilton needed to beat his closest challenger, Vettel, by nine points and Mercedes team-mate Rosberg by two, and he did just that – finishing the race 76 points clear of his nearest rival, with 75 points still available. Rosberg was second and Vettel, who needed to be runner-up if Hamilton won to push the championship into next weekend’s race in Mexico, was third.

Even as he approached the winning line Hamilton could not be certain he had won the championship because Vettel continued to put Rosberg under intense pressure until the end. It was Hamilton’s third win in the four races in Austin as he secured the title with three races to spare.

When he had taken the chequered flag and was congratulated by his team the emotion of the moment finally got to him. “I’m feeling it now, guys, I’m feeling it,” he said. He jumped into a crowd of Mercedes mechanics. Then he was congratulated by the vanquished Rosberg and Vettel. But Rosberg looked less than amused when Hamilton threw a cap into the German’s lap. Rosberg flung it back, without the flicker of a smile.

The race appeared to belong to Rosberg with 15 laps to go. Hamilton was leading, but on old tyres, and Rosberg was closing on him with fresher rubber.

But then Red Bull’s Daniil Kvyat spun off. The safety car came out and Hamilton took his chance to make a second stop. He still had to catch Rosberg and that looked unlikely until the 48th of the 56 laps when the German made a mistake and came off the track, allowing Hamilton through.

The rain which had blighted much of the weekend in Texas finally relented. But its legacy was a damp and occasionally wet track which made this the busiest, most unpredictable of races. The rain had forced the cancellation of qualifying on Saturday and curtailed it on Sunday morning, with grid positions decided by Q2. All the cars started on intermediate tyres.

Lewis Hamilton’s 15-race drive to a third world title Read more

The only predictable thing was the start. Hamilton, who was second on the grid, went straight on the attack and was level with the pole-sitter Rosberg almost immediately. Then, as they went into turn one, Hamilton, on the inside, squeezed his team-mate wide. Rosberg would not yield and the two touched wheels but it was Hamilton’s racing line and the German was forced out, dropping to fourth behind Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo.

It was yet another example of Rosberg’s inability to beat Hamilton in wheel-to-wheel racing. He knew he could not afford to finish second to Hamilton in this race but he could not do anything about it.

Vettel, who had started back in 14th place because of a 10-place grid penalty, refused to let himself drift out of the championship picture and steadily worked his way through the field.

But it was the action at the front of the field that was dominating attention. Hamilton is normally a strong front-runner but he showed signs that he was struggling with his rubber and he was passed by the charging Red Bull of Ricciardo.

Worse was to follow, for he then came under pressure from Rosberg who eventually went past him on the 19th lap. The world champion came in for fresh rubber, the first of the drivers to move on to dry-weather tyres.

Rosberg, recovering well from his setback at the start, now put the squeeze on Ricciardo before taking the lead on lap 23. He followed that by putting in the fastest lap as he attempted to build himself a gap at the front. The freshly shod Hamilton moved past Ricciardo and into second place.

There was bad news for Williams, with Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas dropping out of the race, the team’s first double retirement since the Brazilian Grand Prix of 2012. There were only a dozen finishers in this high-casualty race.

At the halfway stage the safety car was deployed for the first time because Marcus Ericsson’s Sauber had stopped on the track. When the safety car came in, the immediate winner was Vettel, who went past Kvyat to take fourth place.

Then he went past Ricciardo on the outside to take third. The three surviving challenges for the world championship were giving the American crowd a race to remember. And another thrilling drive from Max Verstappen, who came fourth for Toro Rosso, provided more entertainment.

It all climaxed over the last 10 laps with the safety car finally off the track. A nervous Mercedes garage warned Hamilton to “keep it clean”.

But Hamilton was not required to do anything dangerous. With a few laps remaining Rosberg made his mistake and let Hamilton in. At that stage, with Hamilton in front, followed by Rosberg and Vettel – who had overtaken Verstappen for third – Hamilton was world champion.

There was no change at the sharp end after that. The leading three cars kept their places. Verstappen was fourth, Force India’s Sergio Pérez fifth and Jenson Button sixth for McLaren. It had been some race.

The Englishman’s 10th win of the season put him alongside Sir Jackie Stewart with three titles but he is the first British driver to successfully defend his championship.

• Bernie Ecclestone to remain as chief executive • Chase Carey set to become the new chairman

The sale of Formula One to Liberty Media has been agreed in a takeover which values the sport at $8bn.

John Malone, head of the entertainment and communications group, has purchased a controlling interest in the sport from CVC Capital.

Chase Carey, the executive vice-president of 21st Century Fox, has been appointed chairman of the Formula One Group, while Bernie Ecclestone, currently the chief executive, will remain in his position.

Liberty has paid $4.4bn for Formula One, initially for a 18.7% stake before acquiring the remainder on completion of the deal in 2017. CVC will remain shareholders but the voting shares that control the group will pass to Liberty. CVC has owned the sport since 2006, making a huge return on its initial investment of $2bn.

“The transaction price represents an enterprise value for Formula One of $8bn and an equity value of $4.4bn,” Liberty Media confirmed in a statement.

The income from the sale is likely to make F1 the most profitable deal in the investment house’s history. Much is expected of the new owners, with considerable emphasis on pushing the sport into new media and targeting new audiences.

The US-based company has clear intent not only to take advantage of Formula One’s ability to buck downward trends in financial returns but will also use its leverage as a media company to promote the sport and is likely to develop a new business model to back it.

Greg Maffei, the president and chief executive officer of Liberty Media, said: “We think our long-term perspective and expertise with media and sports assets will allow us to be good stewards of Formula One and benefit fans, teams and our shareholders. We are excited to become part of Formula One.”

The statement continued: “After completion of the acquisition Liberty Media will own Formula One and it will be attributed to the Liberty Media Group which will be renamed the Formula One Group.

“Chase Carey will serve as the new chairman of Formula One, succeeding Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, who will remain on Formula One’s board as a non-executive director. Bernie Ecclestone will remain Formula One’s CEO.”

The new owners have also included the option for allowing the F1 teams to participate in the new investment in the sport and said they will discuss the idea further with several that have expressed interest already.

Carey said he was looking forward to the “opportunity to help Formula One continue to develop and prosper for the benefit of the sport, fans, teams and investors alike.”

In the short term, however, Ecclestone, who has run Formula One as a fiefdom for 40 years, will be on hand to see through the takeover, having already said he was expecting to stay on for a further three years. In a statement he said: “I would like to welcome Liberty Media and Chase Carey to Formula One and I look forward to working with them.”

Ecclestone, who is now 85 years old, has largely handled the key tenets of F1’s financial success, which hinges on TV deals and the sale of rights to host races, himself. He likes to do business face to face and make deals that are both personal and private.

The sale of British broadcasting rights for the sport to Sky in 2011 was done and dusted before a bemused paddock had any idea of the deal.

It has been his negotiation of an escalator clause in new race contracts that has ensured the sport’s profits have beaten both inflation and recession in recent years. Having him on board to ensure the lucrative revenue stream that made Liberty’s purchase so attractive in the first place is an unsurprising move for the new owners.

How long they will stick with F1’s old guard in the new era remains to be seen.

If we have learned anything from the previous few Olympics, it is that the Games are going through an identity crisis. Rocked by a doping scandal and with an older audience than ever, the International Olympic Committee is attempting to rehabilitate its image by appealing to a uninterested youth.

With sports such as BMX freestyle and baseball taking their place alongside archaic remnants from the age of imperialism, like modern pentathlon and dressage, it is difficult to know what or who the Olympics represent anymore. If the IOC is serious about joining the brave new world that seems to have passed it by and more importantly if it wants to keep its sponsors happy, it needs to make serious changes – starting with introducing eSports.

The rise of eSports: are addiction and corruption the price of its success? Read more

Described by the organising committee as an opportunity “to inspire new generations and become a turning point and a model for future Olympic Games”, the decision to include events such as surfing and climbing in the programme for the 2020 Games comes across as a desperate and cynical ploy by an organisation that is clinging on to what relevance it once had by including sports they believe will address flagging viewership amongst the under-30s. The inclusion of skateboarding especially smacks of a decision made in a focus group run by a man who uses the word “dude” unironically.

Whatever nostalgia we may have about the Games, the simple truth is they are no longer a celebration of the world’s greatest athletes but rather a corporate exercise in mass marketing. And therein lies eSports’ greatest strength. eSports generated $493m (£386m) in revenue with a global audience of about 320m people in 2016, the eSports website Newzoo reported last year. Purely from a financial standpoint, advertisers are missing a potentially massive opportunity to reach new audiences. There are estimated to be over 100m League of Legends players worldwide, and unlike surfing or softball, it has proven its mass viewing appeal, with 36m unique viewers tuned in for 2015’s League of Legends final between Koo Tigers and SK Telecom, exceeding the 31m people who tuned in to watch the Cleveland Cavaliers, inspired by a virtuoso performance from LeBron James, defeat Golden State Warriors in last year’s NBA Championship decider. Incidentally, that figure is also higher than the average of 27.5m American viewers for the Rio Games.

The Asian Games, the second largest multisport event after the Olympics, is set to feature eSports first as a demonstration event in 2018 as part of the run-up to eSports’ official inclusion as a medal sport in the 2022 Games in Hangzhou, China. This should come as no surprise because of the enormous popularity of eSports across the continent, and especially in the far east. Seoul’s Sangam Stadium, which hosted a World Cup semi-final in 2002, was sold out for the 2014 League of Legends World Final which was broadcast to a global audience of over 27m in 19 different languages. The popularity of eSports is not solely confined to Asia though, with Sweden’s DreamHack, the world’s largest digital festival, hosting a variety of tournaments including games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Street Fighter V, and Heroes of the Storm.

Perhaps one of the main peculiarities of eSports competitions is that they rarely feature sports games. Despite their global popularity, football games such as Fifa lag behind the likes of Dota 2 and Hearthstone, with last year’s Fifa Ultimate Team Championship Final providing the first lucrative opportunity to play the game as it featured a $400,000 prize pool and was broadcast on traditional gaming platforms, YouTube and Twitch as well as BT Sport.

Football teams are slowly starting to embrace the growing trend of global tournaments, with Manchester City, West Ham United, and Wolfsburg all signing professional eSports players, while other teams such as Valencia and Schalke have gone beyond Fifa – the former have a Rocket League team and the latter a League of Legends roster.

Football’s involvement should provide the IOC with the encouragement they need to incorporate eSports onto the Olympic schedule. Its global appeal far outstretches nearly every other sport in the world, while it also makes commercial sense. For the naysayers who claim it will devalue the Olympics to have skinny, pasty, nerds smashing buttons and pretending to shoot one another, just remember – at least it’s not dancing horses.

The dawn of London 2012. Danny Boyle’s opening ceremony has eviscerated any lingering public cynicism, while Team GB’s arrival and the Arctic Monkeys’ cover of the Beatles’ Come Together has thrust everyone inside the Olympic Stadium off their feet. Now, as the intense whoops and waves of noise finally subside, Sebastian Coe, the organiser of the Games, stands up to urge the millions watching to appreciate the unique power of sport.

“There is a truth to sport,” he insists. “A purity, a drama, an intensity – a spirit that makes it irresistible to take part in, and irresistible to watch.”

You might snigger – when has sport ever been pure? But at the time Coe’s words prove instantly prophetic. That night Britain dives headfirst into a 16-day Olympic bender.

Play Video 6:17 How golf and athletics are evolving for a new generation of fans – video

The numbers are extraordinary. Nearly 49 million combined watch the opening and closing ceremonies. More than 17 million watch Usain Bolt streak away with the men’s 100-metres final. And another 12 million watch the home-made joy of Super Saturday as Greg Rutherford, Jessica Ennis-Hill and Mo Farah win gold over 47 eardrum-shattering minutes. That night, a joke goes viral on Twitter. “A ginger, a mixed-race woman and a one-time Somali refugee walk into a pub – and everyone buys them a drink.”

Across London – sullen, manic, head-down London – everyone appears to carry a permanent smile on their face, as if serotonin has been pumped into the water supply. Writing in the Guardian, Jonathan Freedland even asks whether the Games might “mark the end of Britain’s age of decline”. In the midst of such unfettered joy it seems entirely reasonable.

Coe, it seemed, was right. Sport did have this special capacity to unite, delight and inspire.

Hashtag United, Wimbly Womblys and the virtual gamers striking it rich Read more

Spool forward five years, however, and the picture is nowhere near as rosy. There have been shocking revelations of state-sponsored cheating in Russia, which, according to the Canadian law professor Richard McLaren, “corrupted the London Olympics on an unprecedented scale” – while the sordid tales of corruption in the corridors of Fifa and the International Association of Athletics Federations would put a banana republic to shame.

Meanwhile sport no longer appears quite as irresistible to watch, either. In America, ESPN’s subscriber base has gone from 100m in 2011 to 88m according to the latest Nielsen estimates. Meanwhile Sky, which spends £4.2bn a year to show 126 Premier League games, saw average viewing on its live TV channels fall 14% over the past season.

Increasingly viewers want shorter, sharper, bite-sized chunks of entertainment, on mobile devices too. No wonder some of them are scrambling to revamp their product to avoid being regarded as dull and outdated.

The landscape is changing. So what is sport doing about it?

‘More youthful, more urban’

Last week the head of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, announced that freestyle BMX and three-on-three basketball would be introduced as events in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, joining karate, surfing, climbing, skateboarding and baseball/softball. The reason was obvious, although Bach didn’t quite put it in these terms: the Games needed to be funked up for a younger generation.

Bach called it a “step-change” and insisted the Games in Tokyo “will be more youthful, more urban and will include more women”. Many inside the Olympic movement wonder what took him so long.

Certainly the IOC has been late to the party. Twenty20 cricket started in 2004 and quickly became the game’s most popular format. Rugby Sevens has been around since 1883, but since receiving the IOC’s stamp of approval in 2009 it has become more relevant than ever. Others, too, are chasing the millennials – realising that if they do not attract new audiences now, in 10 or 20 years’ time they could be increasingly irrelevant.

And that includes staunchly conservative sports, such as golf. As Keith Pelley, chief executive officer of the European Tour, explains: “There are so many wonderful things about our game. But we are not in 1940 now. Every single sport is looking to adapt to a changing society. If you are not, you are going to fall behind.”

Golf fights old perceptions and drop in players to attract new audience | Ewan Murray Read more

Last month the European Tour hosted its first GolfSixes tournament, featuring 16 two-man teams from 16 countries competing on a specially designed six-hole course at the Centurion Club in St Albans. Each hole had a different theme – the third, for instance, had a long drive competition while the fourth had a 40-second shot clock.

Henni Zuel, who covered the tournament for Sky, believes there were encouraging signs. “Of course it isn’t going to replace the 18-hole game,” she says. “And, as with anything like this, there are going to be things that could be better. But it was really noticeable that it seemed to bring in a younger audience. One of the things I kept hearing from families was that you can take your kids along to six holes, because it is not a massive long walk, and it made for a great atmosphere.”

Athletics is another sport that is tentatively trying to recapture its former glories by slicing and dicing events. The most recent attempt to mix things up is Nitro Athletics – a new format involving six teams of 12 male and 12 female athletes competing in a potpourri of new and old events – which was launched in three Australian cities this year.

There were mixed relays, javelin throwing for distance and accuracy, and a men’s mile where the last-placed runner was eliminated at the end of each of the first three laps of the track.

It attracted a lot of media coverage, largely because Usain Bolt – who was rumoured to have been paid $1m to compete – was there. But not everyone is convinced Nitro Athletics is the way forward. As Jason Henderson, the editor of Athletics Weekly, puts it: “I was left feeling nonplussed. I’m all for experiments and fresh thinking. My problem with Nitro is that not much was earth-shatteringly innovative and some of it even made me cringe.”

His views echo those of agents and race meeting organisers the Guardian has spoken to off the record. They believe Australians came mainly to see Bolt and tick it off their bucket list – rather than for Nitro Athletics.

Another format that has been tried in Britain with some success is street athletics, where fans can get to see the action up close on specially-built tracks in city centres. As Greg Rutherford explains: “I still think the sport is in a bad place, I am not going to lie, but the CityGames showcases the sport in the right way.”

Traditional sports also need to be aware of another factor: the growing popularity of eSports. The mainstream often dismisses them as being played by spotty adolescents who are deprived of vitamin D and a social life. However Mark Borkowski, a PR and brand expert, insists that is a mistake. “I’m 100% sure that minority sports will suffer because it is about eyeballs and selling product and increasingly that’s what eSports do,” he says.

He has a further message for any doubters. “Once upon a time darts and snooker were seen as joke sports played in smoky men’s clubs, but now they are respectable. And I know there are a number of big agencies, who represent Hollywood stars, who are paying close attention to eSports.”

A question of trust

Many problems that sports face are far from fresh. Doping and corruption has festered and lingered for decades. But recently it has developed a fresh twist. Taking performance-enhancing drugs is no longer a black and white issue, but one of ever-darkening shades of grey.

Recently this issue has come worryingly close to home. Who could forget the sight of Bradley Wiggins revelling after adding a London 2012 time trial gold medal to his Tour de France triumph – a victory that not only made him Britain’s most successful Olympian but also the runaway winner of the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year award?

Now Wiggins is fighting to save his reputation amid questions over what was in the jiffy bag delivered and administered to him on the final day of the Critérium du Dauphiné in June 2011 – and whether he might have broken any anti-doping rules at the time. Wiggins is also under pressure on a second front following leaks from the Russian hackers Fancy Bears which showed that he was granted therapeutic use exemptions for the powerful corticosteroid triamcinolone, supposedly for his allergies, before the 2011 and 2012 Tour de France and the 2013 Giro d’Italia. However, the drug – which is illegal to use without a TUE – also has an effect on performance. Wiggins has always maintained he used it to combat pollen allergies and has always denied wrongdoing.

The former professional rider Jörg Jaksche described the effect of triamcinolone as “extreme”, adding: “Your recovery is shorter and the pain you are going through is less. It makes you very skinny. It burns fat. You are going to suffer less. It is the old school of doping.” Taking triamcinolone, or other corticosteroids, might not be against the law, but for some it leaps over an ethical boundary.

Mo Farah, too, has faced heavy scrutiny after his coach, Alberto Salazar, was accused in 2015 of potentially violating anti-doping rules – allegations both Farah and Salazar have vehemently denied. A United States Anti-Doping Agency investigation into Salazar is ongoing. Usada is also looking into Dr Jeffrey Brown, who administered thyroid medication to some of Salazar’s athletes even when they were not suffering from hypothyroidism – behaviour that while not illegal makes some queasy.

And then there is Russia. Thanks to the bravery of whistleblowers such as the 800m runner Yuliya Stepanova, and the former head of the Russian anti-doping agency Grigory Rodchenko, and investigations led by the Canadian lawyers Dick Pound and Richard McLaren, we now know that Russia’s government and sports authorities colluded to ensure that more than 1,000 athletes across 30 sports were able to take a cocktail of banned performance-enhancing drugs yet evade doping tests between 2011 and 2015.

Yet what does it say when the IOC on the one hand called Russia’s behaviour “a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sports and on the Olympic Games”, yet on the other allowed most of their athletes to compete in Rio last year?

Increasingly a sceptical public must wonder whether the lofty words on anti-doping match the reality. Before London 2012, there had been breathless reports about how science was ahead of the dopers, and that the authorities would have 1,000 staff on call 24/7 during the Games. As Dr Matthew Fedoruk, the science director of Usada, put it: “The message to athletes is loud and clear. They shouldn’t show up at the Games and be doping because they’ll be caught.”

Yet that clearly was not the case. It has only been in the past year or so, after hundreds of blood and urine samples from London 2012 were defrosted and retested using a new technique, that dozens more positives have come to light.

As things stand, six of the 13 athletes who competed in the London 2012 women’s 1500m final have been suspended for taking illegal substances at some point in their careers – including the gold and silver medallists Asli Cakir Alptekin and Gamze Bulut, both from Turkey.

And how much have things changed for the better since then? Before the 1500m final in Rio, the American Jenny Simpson questioned whether the Ethiopian world record holder Genzebe Dibaba was clean after her coach Jama Aden was arrested in Spain on suspicion of having performance-enhancing drugs. Dibaba insists she is “crystal clean”, while Aden denied the charges and remains on bail.

“I think that you know a tree by the fruit that it bears,” Simpson said. “And if a tree bears sour fruit, then the fruit around it are likely infected.”

The great unanswered – indeed unanswerable – question is, how many more cheats are out there? We all know that anti-doping agencies are underfunded, and that they find it hard to carry out tests in many areas of the world, including Kenya and Ethiopia. We also suspect that dopers are able to stay several steps ahead of the authorities. The World Anti-Doping Agency often talks about the need for better intelligence and investigations but it only has a yearly budget of around $26m – less than most Premier League teams – and six investigators on its books.

And how can we can be confident that sports are doing everything they can to catch cheats, when the very process of doing so will erode trust in that sport? Just look at what has happened in cycling or track and field.

If athletes such as Simpson don’t have complete faith in the system, why should we?

‘The corruption was embedded’

It doesn’t help, either, that too many international federations have been captured by crooks or chancers. During Sepp Blatter’s tenure as president of football’s world governing body, Fifa became a byword for corruption with officials brazenly lining their own pockets by taking their own cut of TV deals or other scams. At its most nefarious, this meant the US Department of Justice alleging the former Concacaf president Jack Warner had misappropriated funds meant for Haiti earthquake victims.

If anything the IAAF might have behaved even worse, with many senior figures in the organisation having since been expelled for life for their part in extorting €450,000 (£330,000) from the Russian marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova to cover up her doping violations.

The verdict of investigators could not have been more blunt. “It started with the president of the organisation,” they wrote. “It involved the treasurer of the organisation. It involved the personal counsel of the president, acting on instructions of the president. It involved two of the sons of the president. It involved the director of the medical and anti-doping department of the IAAF. The corruption was embedded in the organisation.”

Perhaps the scale of the problem is highlighted by research by the Danish Institute of Sports Studies, who in 2015 ranked all 35 federations belonging to the Olympic family based on how transparent, democratic and accountable they were. Incredibly the organisation that came second, behind only the International Equestrian Federation, was Fifa.

That study also found that only four out of the 35 had a committee that performed integrity and professional checks on those nominated for senior positions, while less than a third published externally audited annual financial reports.

Coe deserves credit for pushing through a new IAAF constitution last year, which included the establishment of the independent Integrity Unit to oversee the entire anti-doping process from testing, term limits for senior officials, and giving athletes a greater say in running the sport than ever before. However, such measures are still highly unusual for most sporting bodies. And with such low levels of scrutiny across the board, how many more Fifas and IAAFs are they out there?

What next?

There are several strands in all this, and many of them should sound alarm bells for sport. When NBC reports a staggering 31% decline in ratings for its prime-time Olympics coverage among adults aged 18-34 between London 2012 and Rio 2016, or total Premier League viewing hours fall by 6%, you know something is afoot.

Yes, some of the fall in figures is down to illegal streaming and the high cost of subscriptions. But much of it is also due to the way we live now: always on the go, always on social media, always trying to doing three things at once. No wonder so many sports are tinkering with formats in a bid to be heard.

Meanwhile some of the scandals we have seen in recent years, and especially those involving Fifa and the IAAF, are having consequences with both organisations struggling to attract big-name sponsors. For the 2014 World Cup, Fifa had 20 corporate partners on board; for Russia 2018 it is half that with sponsors balking at the highest cost and potential risk to their reputation with being involved with Fifa.

Of course when a match or event is about to start, cognitive dissonance usually takes over. Sport might horrify us, but it still draws us in even more. Yet it is hard to argue that for some sports, and especially athletics and cycling, that the endless scandals have not damaged their appeal in some way.

However, speaking to the Guardian recently, Lord Coe insisted he remained optimistic about the power of sport to meet the problems it faces head on.

“By a distance, sport has more to offer than the challenges that are currently confronting it,” he said. “We connect with more people in a more meaningful way than politicians, the church, and financial institutions, and internationally we still have the ability to bring communities and countries together.

“Yes, there are challenges. Yes, we can address them. And can we move on from them? Absolutely yes we can.”

There is no doubting Coe’s conviction. Some of us, however, will need more evidence before believing it.

Sport knows it has a problem. The self-inflicted crises that have occurred over the last few years mean that those in charge of sport are desperately trying to rebuild trust while at the same time increase its appeal to younger fans. In this first film of our Sport 2.0 series, Tom Jenkins explores how athletics and golf are adapting to overcome the challenges they face. Later, we explore the future of football, motor-racing and eSports

Keith Pelley, the European Tour’s chief executive, has introduced new ideas but is looking to push boundaries further to stop UK participation tailing off

The problem with highlighting golf’s struggles is that those at the summit of the game have never had it so good. The US Open this week offers a record prize fund of $12m (£9.5m). One must look seriously hard at the PGA Tour’s schedule to find a tournament which does not bestow immediate millionaire status on the winner.

And yet the feeling persists that golf is a sport from a bygone age, being left behind by those considered more trendy. Other obvious realities play a part; golf remains time-consuming, not always easily accessible and generally expensive.

In the United States 23.8 million people are considered golfers. “You see two and a half million players enter the game this past year,” says Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour’s commissioner. “That’s the highest number on record, exceeding the 2.4 million in 2000 when Tiger Woods was at the top of his game.

Sport 2.0: crumbling traditions create a whole new ballgame | Sean Ingle Read more

“We have 2.9 million juniors; that’s up 25% since 2011. You look at underneath that number, in 1995, 17% of those juniors were female. Now that’s 33%. So you are seeing growth at the junior level. I get the fact that there’s a lot of discussion on the health – and some of it is negative – but I think there are some really positive trends and storylines underneath it.”

That negativity to which Monahan refers is more prevalent in the UK, where there are reportedly 4.5 million golfers and a steady rather than sharp annual drop. Partly linked to economic scenarios from 2008 onwards, clubs have shut down across the country. And many of those which remain have slashed entry costs in a desperate bid to pull in the generation which will take them into a new era.

Basketball, volleyball and hockey feature regularly on school physical education curriculums whereas golf never does. Although impossible to measure, golf may suffer from historical and accurate perceptions of a discriminatory environment. A firm upside might yet be provided by Olympic participation, which was restored for golf in Rio last summer.

“In terms of the golf clubs themselves, I challenge them,” says Keith Pelley, the European Tour’s chief executive. “I challenge them to think differently. I challenge them to look beyond the rules that have always been there and I think this is critical for the success of our game going forward.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Keith Pelley: ‘I thought golf would be higher in the UK psyche than it is’. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian

“There are always going to be clubs who stand above the rest but it is all those other golf courses that will succeed and become even more profitable if they engage more people. The way they are going to engage more people is by thinking outside the box. Let them in. What we don’t want to be is a sport for the elite.”

Pelley personifies golf’s quest to remain relevant. The European Tour smartly recruited the Canadian from outside golf in 2015. That is not the way things tend to happen but it was deliberate; Pelley’s fresh eyes were necessary. “I remember during the interview process, talking about: ‘Are you willing to change? Are you willing to look at all facets of your business and be open to adaptation of any aspect of the game?’” he recalls. “They were emphatic that they were. If you aren’t willing to change, you run the risk of falling further and further behind the phenomenal experience that is Premier League football.

“When you look at golf from a UK perspective, I thought it would be higher in the psyche than it is. That led me to the fact that we need to loosen some of the traditions and open up the game to a much younger generation.

I still think walk-up music to the tee is a horrendous idea. Rory McIlroy

“People’s concentration is different from what it once was. For a 13- or 14-year-old to sit in front of a television for five hours watching golf is not realistic. For them to play golf two or three times a week for that long, with everything else they have at their disposal, is not realistic.”

The European Tour has already experimented with a Golf Sixes team competition. Music has been heard blaring out from certain events, not that it has met with universal approval. “I still think walk-up music to the tee is a horrendous idea,” says the world No2, Rory McIlroy.

More serious is where precisely tournament golf, while maintaining professional interest but attracting a bigger audience, may go. Pelley believes the likes of the Masters and Open Championship will always retain blue-chip status – and these events continue to expand – as more standard tour stops are subject to tweaks.

“The other events run the risk, based on the saturation of content that’s out there, of being vulnerable,” Pelley adds. “That’s where creativity needs to come in. That’s where innovation needs to be at the forefront. I do see a world where there are 72-hole tournaments and there are 10-15 of them but all the others have a different format. A format that engages people in a completely different way.”

Six appeal: innovation is good but golf’s problem is lack of exposure | Ewan Murray Read more

But what of an improved spectator experience? “Play the actual hole that you are watching on your broadcast, right there,” says Pelley. “So if somebody makes a putt for an eagle on the 15th at Augusta, you can do it in your living room. It will happen, it’s going to happen. To be in the shoes of that professional, even just for a second, I do believe that is the future.

“I think a stadium event will happen. Wouldn’t it be terrific to have an incredible video board where you have players on the pitch, so you can see every single shot by every single player. It would be a completely different consumption of the game. Maybe that’s where the six-hole games goes. Maybe it becomes stadium sport.”

McIlroy might have an aversion to Rihanna blaring out at his work but he remains one of the most identifiable and appealing individuals in his sport. “Golf needs characters; look at Rickie Fowler, we need more people like that. Kids can relate to him,” he says. “I think we have to move with the times, moving accordingly with whatever technology is out there; be that virtual reality, live PGA Tour streaming via Twitter or whatever it may be.

“I think people are getting sick and tired of watching tour rounds that are five, five-and-a-half hours long. I understand that, people don’t have the time. Speeding up the game is one of the most important things we need to do.”

With its own dedicated fromagerie, microbrewery and Michelin-calibre restaurant, it might be easy to forget you have come to watch the football when you are reclining in one of the premium lounges of Tottenham Hotspur’s new £750m stadium. The 61,000-seat behemoth will feature the longest bar in the country, heated seats with built-in USB ports, a glass-walled tunnel so you can see the players before the game and even a “sky walk” allowing fans to clamber over the roof of the arena.

“It will be the most technically advanced stadium in the world,” says Christopher Lee, an architect with Populous, the sports and entertainment giant behind the design of the new-look White Hart Lane. “It has to provide a reason for people to get off their sofas and leave their 50-inch flatscreen TVs.”

As home entertainment systems become ever more elaborate, allowing fans to watch the action from every conceivable angle in ultra-high-definition, the conventional football stadium is having to up its game to lure people from the comfort of their homes. The promise of a pie, a pint and a good singsong in the stands just is not enough.

“People expect more from the experience and they’re willing to pay for it,” says Lee. While premium seat tickets to Tottenham’s gargantuan silver spaceship will start at £89, membership of its exclusive H Club – which comes with “provision for guests to store their personal vintage wines, cognacs and liquors in a purpose-built, temperature-controlled on-site reserve” – will cost £30,000 for two. That’s the price you must pay for enjoying a plate of specially sourced half-time cheese.

Besides the fancy catering, the football pitch itself has to work a lot harder, too. This is the first field of its kind designed to split into three parts and slide seamlessly under the seating stands, revealing an astroturf field beneath for American football, positioned at a lower level to ensure perfect sight lines for both modes of play. Acoustic consultants were brought on board in order to guarantee maximum amplification of crowd noise, ensuring a “wall of sound” will resonate from the 17,000-seat south stand, conceived as a single tier to rival the Kop at Anfield or the Yellow Wall at Borussia Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion.

So, having reached the apogee of transformable robotic pitches, exclusive fine dining suites and perfectly tuned seating, what next for the future of stadiums?

Lee, who has worked on major sports venues around the world, says technology is having a huge impact on how these buildings are being imagined. “Twenty years ago we put screens into stadiums,” he says. “But now we all carry a supercomputer in our pockets, so there are opportunities for layering the viewing experience – from seeing different camera angles in your seat, to tracking the heart rate, speed and impact of players wearing smart clothing on the pitch.”

He says the next big frontier is holographic representation, describing a world where players might be beamed on to the field from thousands of miles away. “In the not-too-distant future you can imagine Real Madrid supporters in São Paulo watching the game in their stadium at the same time as the fans in Spain,” he says. “It’s all about coming together for the collective experience.”

It may sound far-fetched but the technology is already here. In its bid for the 2022 World Cup, Japan promised to record games in 360 degrees with 200 HD cameras and broadcast them around the world live in 3D, allowing players to appear in hundreds of stadiums simultaneously as holographic projections. Microphones embedded below the pitch would have recorded every ball kick and tackle whimper, adding to the sense of realism.

While Japan’s sci-fi dream lost out to the rippling vaginal vision of Qatar’s stadium plans, it is American football in the US that is now leading the way in developing next generation venues. Given the eye-watering sums generated from the sale of TV rights (with deals worth $27bn), each team in the National Football League is desperately trying to build bigger video screens and provide faster in-seat wifi than the next, even if most fans will never have the chance to experience it in person. The new $1.6bn Atlanta Falcons stadium, currently under construction and due to open later this year, will feature the world’s first 360-degree video wall, running for 335m around the bowl, as well as a vast a rotating oculus roof, inspired by the wings of a falcon, made of eight 500-ton moving pieces. At one point it was even going to include vibrating seats.

“NFL has become an arms race,” says the architect John Rhodes of HOK, the firm behind the Atlanta project. “It used to be about sheer size, but now everyone’s focused on the convergence of the physical and digital experience, increasing connectivity in the stadium to bring fans closer to the players.”

He says that parametric modelling techniques are having an effect on the geometry of the seating bowl, too, the layout generated by a whole host of interconnected parameters, from acoustics to distance from the bar and proximity to the bench. He sees a future where the seating bowl might be fragmented into smaller groups of 50-100 people, creating “group suites” to intensify the physical and social interaction between fans, while drones will become a ubiquitous feature – for more than providing an elaborate backdrop to a Lady Gaga performance at half-time.

“I don’t imagine drones will be delivering beers to your seat, as some people think,” he says, “but I can definitely see linear bars served by drones running around the outside of concourse. It could have a revolutionary impact on how we think of concessions and eliminate queuing.”

Others are less enamoured with the high-tech dream. Jacques Herzog of Herzog & de Meuron, the Pritzker Prize-winning Swiss architects behind several renowned stadiums, from the inflatable bubble of the Allianz Arena in Munich to the steel tangle of Beijing Bird’s Nest, to the colossal brick cathedral of Chelsea’s forthcoming new stadium, thinks it might all be a distraction. “Everything is becoming too artificial,” he says. “It’s like when I watch my son playing Fifa on his console. If you have artificial lawns and roofs to keep out the rain and snow, you lose the physical authenticity of the moment and make it more of a virtual thing.”

He says his focus is always on capturing the local specificity of the place, designing a venue that somehow responds to the fan culture of the team in question, whether that’s a glowing lantern for Munich, a sharp white temple for Bordeaux, or an archaic masonry complex of vaults and buttresses for Stamford Bridge. For every project his practice reinvents the model.

“Our Bordeaux stadium is very refined to fit with the city’s elegant urban plan, but in London this would be absurd,” he says. “Equally if we took our Stamford Bridge project to Munich it would look like Lord of the Rings.” He describes his forthcoming Chelsea stadium as “almost Roman” in its raw heft, the polar opposite to Tottenham’s shiny UFO.

“Above all,” he adds, “both football and architecture need to keep that sense of the real. The smell of the grass, the proximity of the players to the fans. People come to watch games to have all of their senses stimulated – that’s what architecture must amplify.”

As part of Tom Jenkins’ series of films the Guardian spoke to Sebastian Coe, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations. Ever since he assumed the position in August 2015 the sport has been mired in crisis – from allegations of deep-rooted corruption during the tenure of his predecessor, Lamine Diack, to state-sponsored doping and a battle to engage a new generation of participants and viewers. Even as the popularity of running has boomed, the status of athletics has declined in inverse proportion and a sport that once commanded peak-time viewing is among those battling for its life in the face of myriad challenges.

Guardian Sport: How do you begin regaining trust in your sport?

SC: “You have to start somewhere. My instincts were that we had to start by rebuilding the foundations. The first year was not a page turner but we moved the dial a long way very quickly. In the course of a year we rewrote the constitution of the sport, we created the integrity unit and that is up and running. It doesn’t answer the next question, which is ‘OK, that’s fine but how does that really manifest itself in terms of a return to trust?’. I tend to think of a triangle – you need trust, you need good leadership and you need relevance. The one crucial asset my sport has is that more people globally do what we do than any other sport. The first advantage we have is more people run than cycle or swim or do triathlon. We have to make sure the people doing that in their millions feel an affinity with what is going on in the sport and feel this is a movement they want to be part of and not a movement that is tainted.”

Your sport has been brought to its knees by a succession of crises. Is it not fatally undermined?

SC: “I don’t want to remotely diminish the importance or the challenge of those various crises. But I do draw comfort from sitting in the crowd at meetings. I do compete in Parkruns, I do compete in 10ks – albeit at the back of the field – and I’ve not found there has been any loss of excitement or ambition about being involved in the sport. People have been able to separate their own enjoyment of being involved in the running movement without it being undermined by the fragilities elsewhere. We don’t like those fragilities, they have hit us hard and they have damaged us. But they are not stopping people wanting to be part of our sport. There was no sign last year of a diminution of the gates at our stadiums.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘There is a great deal we can do to restore support and trust in the sport.’ Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian

But won’t it reach a tipping point?

SC: “We’ve got to do everything we can as quickly as we can to make sure we don’t reach that tipping point. Rio as a sporting event, particularly for athletics, was the best event we’ve had. We had more records than ever before, more countries competing than ever before and more countries winning medals than ever before. Poor leadership doesn’t impact on performance, because the athletes repeatedly punch through the fragilities we’ve had.”

But clearly there must be a link between the evaporation of trust and whether parents want their children to take up the sport or watch it?

SC: “When I set off on the path of reform I had two groups absolutely at the top of my list in order to protect and preserve and create confidence. The first was the clean athletes – if we’re in a system where no one cares if athletes are clean or not, then we’re in the knacker’s yard. The other group are parents. They have a huge impact on the sport their kids take up. We can’t have parents and grandparents thinking: ‘Hmm, maybe athletics isn’t the sport for us because there is going to be a risk that at the age of 16 or 17 you’re going to have an unscrupulous coach or a chancer agent saying there is a shortcut to doing what most of us have done cleanly for most of our athletics career.’ They were the two groups those reforms were absolutely aimed at.”

In today’s fragmented world with so many choices open to young people, can athletics ever be among the top three or four sports in the country again?

SC: “I don’t know. If I’m being honest maybe not. But there is a great deal we can do to restore support and trust in the sport. We have to be more innovative, we have to be braver and more creative in formats. The first thing I said when I became president was that we have to think differently. The Australians did. They came forward with Nitro. It’s not going to be the universal panacea. You might not see elimination miles in London this summer or the Olympics in 2020, but there are some clues there. There was better athlete engagement, the event was over in just over two hours, the stadium didn’t look like a car boot sale. You were focusing on one event per moment and young people seemed excited. In a country hemorrhaging athletics support, we had full stadiums. Are we going to get back to the point where the Nine O’Clock News breaks into a world record attempt of mine in 1981? Possibly not. But there is a lot more we can do to be more relevant and more exciting. We’ve got to be brave about it.”

Why hasn’t the sport evolved?

SC: “The sport has been too beltway. We’ve spoken to each other. I won the English Schools title 44 years ago and the format hasn’t changed. I’m pretty much watching the same format over the same period of time. I can’t think of any sport that’s remained inviolate to change for that amount of time. Twenty20 has done it well, look at Rugby Sevens. Look at Formula-E. Even watching Chelsea the other day, I noticed the player of the match was selected by the fans. To say Usain Bolt, probably the most recognisable athlete on the planet, doesn’t get into the top 30 on Snapchat or Instagram is pretty insightful.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Usain Bolt salutes the crowd after running his final race in his home country, Jamaica, last week. Bolt partied with his devoted fans in an emotional farewell. Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images

How can you cope without Usain Bolt?

SC: “We need to work harder to make sure that the Wayde van Niekerks, the David Rudishas and the Valerie Adamses are being given the horsepower to help fill the void. But there is going to be a void, no doubt about it. No one immediately found a replacement for Muhammad Ali but plenty of great boxers came along in his wake. There isn’t going to be another Usain Bolt for some time but there are things we can do to lessen the impact of that loss.”

These are practical things. What about the more philosophical impact of the cynicism that now surrounds your sport and others? Has it gone too far?

SC: “No, it hasn’t. Sport has gone through what global financial organisations have been through, the Church, the royal family. That’s what sport has been through and we have to adjust to it. What sport hasn’t properly understood is that the basis of power has changed. My federation was founded in 1912 and I only had five predecessors. It will come as huge relief to my family that I don’t intend to be there for 31 years. I think what sport hasn’t properly understood is that the average CEO probably only stays for five years. You need oxygen and you need change. You need a churn of people coming in and you need outsiders coming in. Sport doesn’t have the monopoly of wisdom and it does need to reach out. We’re not too far down the road to make sure we put the right things in place to hold on to the upper ground.”

The London Stadium will be sold out this summer for the world athletics championships. But a lot of the great things about London 2012 have been undercut by cynicism. Do people feel differently about cycling and athletics than they did then?

SC: “They probably do. But I don’t think that’s a permanent shift. The point I’d make more broadly is that, yes, people want higher standards in sport. People want higher standards in business, in schools, in politics, probably in their own families most of the time. That’s a natural human instinct. But I also think people are capable of saying that by a distance sport has more to offer than the challenges confronting it. We do something in society that no other area does.”

Does it matter if someone feels differently about Mo Farah or Bradley Wiggins, given the allegations against them?

SC: “I would rather people felt complete comfort that what they are watching is legitimate. The only thing I’d say is that they have, with some justification, should have a greater confidence in what they’re watching than 20 or 30 years ago. Systems are better. We are discussing it and we wouldn’t have been 20 or 30 years ago. We can go back 10 years and take medals off people. If you don’t go fishing, you can’t catch fish. I’d rather have the embarrassment of some high profile positives and uncovering some uncomfortable things than sitting there in gentle decline. I’d rather encounter it front on.”

When we’re back in the Olympic Stadium this summer, will you reflect on the difficulties of the Olympic legacy?

SC: “We are making a difference. I went to the Olympic Park the other day to watch one of my daughters play in a schools hockey tournament. The place was heaving. The stadium was being used, the swimming pool was full, there were queues of people trying to get into the velodrome, you couldn’t get a court at the tennis centre and there were schools playing on the hockey pitches. Affordable housing, families, life in an area that didn’t have that. Inspire a generation wasn’t just getting more people to participate, it was about improving elite level sport. We go from London to Rio as the only city that has gone on to secure a bigger medal haul four years later. That has clearly inspired a generation.”

Matt Wallace has learned to trust those with a hunch. The finest endorsement for those who believed in the 27-year-old will arrive on Thursday morning when he makes his major championship debut, at the US Open. A year ago, Wallace was enjoying the most fruitful spell of an unremarkable career, winning three times on the Alps Tour, where first prizes occasionally approach £10,000. There was also a meeting with Chubby Chandler, the influential agent, when Wallace attended the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth as a spectator.

“This is freaky,” Wallace says. “It was the first time I’d ever met him. He said: ‘You know what, Matt? You are going to be playing here next year.’ I said: ‘Shut up. I’m on the Alps Tour, I have to play Challenge Tour, win things there … how am I even going to get close?’”

Wallace did tee up in the European Tour’s marquee English event having benefited from two things: his own ability and another demonstration of confidence, this time from Keith Pelley. It was the Tour’s chief executive who invited Wallace to last month’s Portugal Open where he opened with a 63, won the tournament and thereby earned full playing status.

“I spoke to Keith at Wentworth,” says Wallace. “I wrote him a letter of thanks, he got that and came to see me. He said: ‘I really appreciate the letter.’ I was like: ‘Well, I really appreciate you changing my life.’ He said: ‘You are exactly the reason why we give invites. You showed you could take your chance when we gave you that invite.’”

Wallace’s earlier periods on the road provide insight into a division far removed from the US Open, for which he earned a place from a play-off at international qualifying. The field at Erin Hills will compete for a prize fund of $12m (£9.4m). For Wallace, there was the distribution of a business plan to potential sponsors so that he could collect even some of the minimum £17,000 per year needed to play on the Alps Tour.

“I always felt like if I was able to go to events, I could win and make a living,” he says. “That’s how I spoke to people; some took an interest, others didn’t. I only had a couple of people helping me and you would have a certain amount of money to last five or six events. After that, I had to pay my own way so that was tough.

“Even in the year where I won six times, it was great but not significant or life-changing money and I was having to pay a lot of stuff off with what I won. I was getting sponsorship, maybe £5,000, so from there on I was paying with whatever I earned.”

Wallace is clearly confident but self-deprecating about his route to the top. “My parents are PE teachers, my whole family is very sporty. I was very good at pretty much all sports. I played really high-level cricket, football and rugby. I didn’t play golf seriously until I was 18.

“From 18 my head was on the wrong way, I worked for Hollister and was out partying all the time. I changed that when I was 20 when I had this thought of: ‘What am I going to do when I’m 30? I have nothing.’

“I wanted to go to America and get my degree. I did that on a scholarship to Jacksonville State and went there for a year. I was at the wrong university; I was the No1 there, won events, helped their ranking then got called into the England first team. I thought it was all going in the right direction but I still wasn’t any good. I was just playing with what I was given, talent, and that was it.

“I always managed to score and get it round. That helps me now. I wasn’t that good but I could and can play from positions others aren’t used to because I’ve been in those situations. I’ve changed my technique, because I had to, and I’m a proper golfer now. I’m quite confident standing next to anyone on the range and hitting shots.”

Wallace’s development is fascinating on two counts. That he is a prolific winner – the eventual tally on the Alps Tour last year was six – sets him apart from others, regardless of where those successes took place. At 27, and having turned professional in 2012, he is also relatively late to the high-level party. Wallace regularly doubted experiences like this “best six months of my life” would ever transpire. “I have worked really hard for years but over the first couple, I didn’t see much happening with my game,” he says.

Alex Noren hits course record to win BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth Read more

“I didn’t see any purchase or any outcome which suggested I was going to be a professional golfer. I spoke to a few of my friends about giving it up at the end of 2013. I was busy writing a new CV. In hindsight, working hard wasn’t the right thing; I had to work a lot smarter.

“At the end of 2015 I changed coach after being in position a few times on the Alps Tour but not winning. It wasn’t mental; I felt great every time I was in position. It wasn’t nerves. Under pressure, my technique wasn’t holding up. I worked on my technique, made that a lot better and now have a great team around me.”

That coaching switch led to the widely respected Matt Belsham overseeing stunning improvement. Among Belsham’s other pupils is the world No8 Alex Noren. “This is a guy who I idolise,” says Wallace of the Swede. “His work ethic and his technique are brilliant. He isn’t completely happy with the way he swings it so there is a grey area where he is winning but he is always working to get better. That’s where I am because I never had great technique and it’s technique that gets the ball to go where you want it to.”

Chandler delivered a “told you so” message as Wallace lifted the trophy in Portugal. “I’ve taken so much confidence from someone of his stature telling me I was going to do all right,” says the man from west London. He will cherish Erin Hills more than most.

This week’s roundup also features a cow and a bull; England’s greatest penalty shootouts; and darts referees in alphabetical order shouting ‘180’

1) Need a Wimbledon mood-setter? Here’s 1961’s Pathé guide, featuring a trademark jaunty soundtrack, details on how the balls were made, and footage of a school chaplain training the ball boys. “Practice makes perfect, and for Wimbledon the preparations couldn’t be more punctilious.” See also Pathé’s 1954 “The Way To Wimbledon” documentary, which starts here. “There’s something besides the conflict of strings and tennis balls that extends Wimbledon beyond the simple courts into a function, a ritual and a challenge.” There’s plenty of vintage tennis action in the Pathé vaults too – including Helen Wills-Moody (“Invincible Helen”) winning again in 1930, and Fred Perry’s 1934 highlights.

2) It’s Tour de France time, too, so here’s a first-person view of last year’s most unlikely moment: an inflatable advertising arch taking a dislike to Adam Yates. Among other edgy Tour clips: a support car staff member’s perspective on dealing with a nasty pile-up in 2015; Lance Armstrong’s crash and recovery in 2003 via an, erm, “massive surge of adrenaline”; and the rider Kevin Reza deftly scooping up a fan’s dropped camera in 2014, and shooting a film of his legs in action.

3) Firefighters parked up at the World Touring Car Championship in Vila Real last week were given a jolt when the driver Tom Coronel went straight on at a corner. They all emerged unscathed, but the car was left crumpled. “The engine was dislocated, the suspension was broken, there was damage to the bodywork and chassis,” said Coronel. “The car really was like a banana.”

4) Good news for continuity fans: England’s football identity is safe with the next generation. Here’s the senior side’s complete set of penalty shootout memories: World Cup 1990, Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle doing their thing against West Germany; Gareth Southgate stepping up against Germany in 1996; Paul Ince and David Batty folding against Argentina in 1998; David Beckham and Darius Vassell missing at Euro 2004; Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher matching them in 2006; and Ashley Young and Ashley Cole staying on message in 2012. But it doesn’t always follow the script: here’s England’s 1996 quarter-final effort against Spain, with Pearce, sort of, making amends.

5) Inspired by this cow at Kerridge v Mossley, this bull gets a pre-season friendly under its belt in Bulgaria.

6) And here’s some shirt-pulling done properly, via Sandefjord midfielder Pau Morer. His effort joins the list of other shirt-based hits: this subtle tug going unpunished but still leaving its mark; another player hitching a ride; why grabbing your own shirt is neither big nor clever; and Jan Vertonghen showing that even if the shirt is out of reach, there’s always an another option.

1) An elegant new entry in the always engaging Best Dive Ever category. Nice work, Lucas Fonseca.

2) Here’s some vintage lollipop mayhem from Roma’s Mancini against Lyon in 2007. Always looks so good when it comes off. And so bad when it doesn’t.

3) Hype fans will relish this stirring unofficial McGregor v Mayweather promo trailer. It contains ripe language, Gangsta’s Paradise and hot takes: “This is the biggest fight ever in the history of two people punching each other.”

4) All the darts referees, in alphabetical order, shouting “180”. Unsettling.



5) And marvel as an unassuming-looking robot spends a few moments weighing up its heftier Robot Wars opponent, then makes a decisive move. Don’t blink.

The Lions do not lack ambition and they would be too strong for South Africa and Australia but they have reflected the Six Nations – full-blooded yet limited

The Lions have been here before, trying to recover the series after losing the first Test in New Zealand. The last time they did so successfully was in 1993 when, after losing to a late, disputed penalty in the opening match, they went to Wellington needing to win to stay alive.

It was the first time they had not played a four-Test series against the All Blacks (the 1908 tour was an Anglo-Welsh affair with Ireland and Scotland opting not to take part) and they had come from behind to win the three-match rubber against Australia four years before.

The headline selection was made in the centre where Scott Gibbs, who had been unavailable for the first because of injury, replaced the then England captain Will Carling. Gibbs went to New Zealand as an outside-centre and returned as a 12, converted by Ian McGeechan, who was to do the same to Jamie Roberts in South Africa 16 years later.

Lions’ ‘Geography Six’ have no regrets but confess to wanting more game time Read more

The Lions played in Wellington, at the old Athletic Park, as if their careers depended on the result. The first two occasions Rob Andrew received the ball, he stuck it high in the air, inducing mistakes. The tourists’ pack swarmed the field, the set-pieces were mastered and the outcome was a 20-7 victory, in a match refereed by a Frenchman, that took the series to the final day at the end of a week when New Zealand’s media had ripped into the hosts.

There has never been a bad All Blacks team. They have ranged from good to exceptional and in 1993 they were the former, recovering from a disappointing World Cup campaign in 1991 and yet to embrace the more open, flowing style being favoured by some of the leading provinces in New Zealand, most notably Otago, who beat the Lions 37-24, and Canterbury. By 1995, the national side had caught up.

The scorn heaped on the Lions and their coaching staff in New Zealand for their playing style was not aimed at the All Blacks 24 years ago. Mocking up Warren Gatland as a clown, as one newspaper did this week having done so to Australia’s Michael Cheika last year, not only debases debate but ignores the constraints Gatland and his coaches are working under.

The first is that they are up against opponents who have been dominant this decade, losing rarely and often shredding defences into tiny pieces. The second is a schedule that works against a squad made up of players from four countries and the third, which is highlighted on a tour to New Zealand, is their relatively low skill level which is exposed under pressure.

New Zealand’s style has evolved in the last 20 years through financial necessity in large part. Tickets take some selling in all three major southern hemisphere countries, but in Europe the Six Nations plays mainly to packed houses with most matches sold out well in advance.

Tickets sell themselves, eliminating the need to market matches on style of play. This year’s Six Nations was typical in producing a number of close, hard-fought matches brimful of endeavour and muscularity. The overall risk factor was low, although Scotland counterattacked and England looked to produce quick ball, but suddenly players have to adapt in a country where even the weakest opponents on the tour, the Provincial Barbarians, had a firm grasp of the game’s rudiments and no little skill. In boxing, Europe would be seen as a slugger and New Zealand Muhammad Ali.

New Zealand rugby used to be known for its unsmiling nature and its tendency to find a way to win, such as Andy Haden’s dive in Cardiff in 1978. The first Test showed that the resort to width and risk has not come at the expense of the game’s basics: the All Blacks remain winners and will do whatever it takes but now when they are under pressure, they do not have to simulate ballet moves at a lineout but trust their ability and rely on the understanding of the players that turns the outrageous into the expected.

Gatland has been sneered at in his homeland, but how was he meant to get his players to climb several rungs above the standard of the Six Nations? It is not down to him that prime try-scoring opportunities have been created in every match of the tour but only a small percentage turned into points. He, like Graham Henry before him, had taken only a couple of Wales training sessions when he wondered aloud at the wide disparity between talent and basic skills that was absent in New Zealand.

The Lions have not lacked ambition this tour and they would be too strong for South Africa and Australia, but they are not equipped to play with the same verve and pizzazz of their opponents this summer. They have reflected the Six Nations, full-blooded but limited. England, whose head coach Eddie Jones recognises that winning the 2019 World Cup will mean finding a way of beating the All Blacks that goes far beyond landing the most penalties in a dour encounter, struggled under pressure in Dublin.

Wales and Ireland were the biggest disappointments in the Six Nations, the former uninspiring and devising various ways of squandering overlaps, the latter too risk averse despite their November victory over New Zealand. Perhaps the answers lie underneath: just as Otago and Canterbury nudged the All Blacks 24 years ago, so the Scarlets showed in winning the Pro 12 that flair and boldness have not abandoned the Welsh game while Leinster, led by emerging backs Garry Ringrose and Joey Carbery, played with a verve the national side did not reach for.

It may be this weekend that the Lions prevail through fire and passion and bludgeon New Zealand into committing errors and conceding penalties, but why aim low? They have the forwards to generate prime set-piece possession and control the breakdown and outside backs with pace. Passing is an issue, but less so if Jonathan Sexton and Owen Farrell are together in the midfield.

A two-tone approach of zap at forward and zip behind would better maximise scoring potential than trying to drag down the All Blacks, a side that only needs 10 minutes on top to win a match. It does not mean trying to replicate New Zealand, something that would involve overhauling the coaching of young players in the four home unions and putting skills before the gym, but making the most of what the Lions have. There is no one way to play the game: the best are able to do it every which way.

1) Goran Ivanisevic (2001)

Wimbledon has been handing out wildcards since 1977, sprinkling the draw with young guns, home hopefuls and fading stars in a bid to spice up the opening week. Only one player has taken their golden ticket and run all the way to a singles title, like a fun runner breaking the tape on the Mall. Sometimes, you have to start with the obvious one.

The date is 5 July 1998 and Goran Ivanisevic is inconsolable. The Croatian has just lost his third Wimbledon final, falling in five sets to Pete Sampras. In the post-match press conference, he is asked whether he will head to Paris for his nation’s World Cup semi-final. His reply is theatrical but startling: “I cannot cheer anybody now. I can only kill myself.”

The Joy of Six: Wimbledon upsets Read more

Blessed with an ultra-90s big-serving style never likely to entice neutrals, Ivanisevic had become a loveable loser, a player with great talent and charisma but lacking bottle, in contrast to the robotic Sampras. This defeat proved too much to brush off; between October 1999 and May 2001, Ivanisevic won one grand slam match, his career suffocated by injury and unfulfilled destiny.

Ivanisevic returned to SW19 three years later, a 150-1 outsider, ranked 125th in the world, being given a chance to have one last look around the place. The opening rounds were kind, allowing him to fire up that industrial serve against qualifier Fredrik Jonsson, the grass-averse Carlos Moya and an inexperienced Andy Roddick. Next up was Greg Rusedski, adopted Briton and another dangerous outsider. Ivanisevic won in three sets, producing a service clinic so brutal that at one stage, Rusedski handed his racket to a ball boy. Later that afternoon, Sampras lost at Wimbledon for the first time in five years, to a teenage tyro named Roger Federer. The 2001 men’s singles had fallen through the looking glass. Anything was possible.

That’s not to say the quarter-finals weren’t stacked. Ivanisevic was the only unseeded player standing, and came up against No4 seed Marat Safin. He won in four sets, easily the better player, before tearing off his shirt in celebration. “The pressure is growing because now I think I can win it,” he said afterwards. In the semi-final at least, the pressure would remain firmly on the other side of the net.

Tim Henman had lost to Sampras in the 1998 and 1999 semis, and the American’s absence put an unprecedented spring in his step. He saw off Federer in four sets (yes, you read that correctly) and taking on the burden of expectation as much as Ivanisevic, the No6 seed found top gear, winning the third set 6-0 to lead 2-1. Then, as Goran put it: “God sent the rain.”

When play resumed on Saturday, Henman had been given too much time to think, and lost the fourth set in a tie-break. The rain came again, and with it the certainty that this golden opportunity would slip through Henman’s hands. On the match’s third day, Ivanisevic broke in the deciding set’s eighth game and served out. He would play Pat Rafter in the first ever Monday men’s final.

Classic Wimbledon report: Henman loses nerve and his best chance goes begging Read more

Centre Court was packed with raucous, partisan fans for a match like no other. Ivanisevic twice led only to combust, his first-serve percentage plummeting in the second set and his anger at the umpire boiling over in the fourth. In an enthralling final set, Ivanisevic found groundstrokes to match the precision of his serve, and with the atmosphere crackling to a crescendo, he wrestled a break from Rafter at the eighth time of asking.

The score was 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 2-6, 8-7, but the drama wasn’t over. On his first championship point, the game’s most lethal server double faulted. On his second, he did so again, caustic anxiety bubbling to the surface. He won a third, clutching his racket in prayer, but was denied by a divine Rafter lob. On his fourth attempt, on second serve, the collective will of the universe carried Rafter’s return into the net.

At the glorious apex of an on-court career where his heart stayed firmly on his sleeve, Ivanisevic showed unexpected composure – until a moment, halfway up the stand, when the realisation truly set in. For him, this was never a fairytale. “I am going to win Wimbledon one day,” he had vowed in 1998. Few in the room that day believed it, but he did. In the end, that was all that mattered.

2) Zina Garrison (1982)

In May 1982, Houston high school student Zina Garrison faced a dilemma – attend her graduation, or compete in the French Open. Garrison, the junior US Open and Wimbledon champion, chose the latter – reaching the quarter-finals and eliminating former champion Mima Jausovec. Her run was ended by Martina Navratilova, but she had done more than enough to earn a spot in the Wimbledon draw.

Garrison blazed through the opening three rounds, and impressed former winner Evonne Goolagong in their second-round match. “She’s so fast, athletic and goes for her shots. She has a lot of potential,” the former champion said afterwards. Garrison again fell to Navratilova, but this was the 80s – nobody beat Navratilova.

Just as Garrison’s star was rising, her mother became seriously ill, and died in September 1983. Stricken by grief, Garrison began to suffer from bulimia. “Even though I was training hard I felt constantly tired,” Garrison told the Observer in 2006. My appearance was deteriorating. I never told anyone what I was doing to myself.” She reached the Wimbledon semi-finals in 1985 (losing to you-know-who) but her potential had remained largely unfulfilled, before a chance viewing of a TV programme while on tour inspired her to seek help. A career resurgence saw Garrison win two medals at the 1988 Olympics, but it was Wimbledon where her comeback became complete.

In 1990, Garrison beat Monica Seles and Steffi Graf in an extraordinary run to the final, becoming the first black female finalist since Althea Gibson in 1958. In the final, she met Navratilova again, a player she had a 1-33 record against. Garrison would be denied again but “loved every minute” of the experience. She also made an impression on two girls watching in LA – Venus Williams and her sister, Serena, stepped up their interest in tennis after watching Garrison on the big stage.

3) Pat Cash (1986)

When Pat Cash scaled the Centre Court grandstands in 1987, moments after beating Ivan Lendl in the final, he created a Wimbledon tradition still observed today. Cash’s ascent that day mirrored his rise from the moment he touched down in London as a 16-year-old, but belied a collapse in form and fitness that meant just one year earlier, he had been prepared to turn his last chance down.

The Joy of Six: tennis tantrums Read more

A punchy serve-and-volleyer and 1982 junior champion, Cash was first unleashed on the main event in 1983, beating Mats Wilander on his way to the fourth round. A year later, a still teenage Cash made the semi-finals, where he faced John McEnroe. Leading the second-set tie-break at changeover, the challenger gave the world No1 a nudge with his shoulder as they passed. McEnroe rallied to reach the final, but the moment stayed with him: “I thought, this kid’s got the right attitude.”

The year 1985 was set to be the Australian’s breakthrough one but it turned into a nightmare. A persistent back injury meant he missed three slams, and his stepbrother took his own life. As Wimbledon came around the following year, Cash was world No413 and had become a father. A persuasive friend convinced him to accept a wildcard, but a painful twist appeared set to finish his promising career for good.

Cash began to suffer severe stomach pains a month before the tournament, and required an emergency operation to remove his appendix. Incredibly, he showed up at SW19 regardless – and won his first three matches. Facing Wilander in the fourth round, Cash produced a virtuoso display of physical tennis – diving, charging and, as one reporter put it, “hitting the grass more than a dorm full of students”. He lost to Henri Leconte in a four-set quarter-final, but his reputation was restored. He had captivated the locals, beginning the tradition of flinging his headband into the crowd after each match. Cash was back from the wilderness, and 12 months later, he began another tradition, an enduringly beloved champion.

4) Samantha Smith (1998)

Wildcards have been good news for one group in particular – those in possession of a UK passport and a racket. To give but one example, Alex Bogdanovic (highest world ranking: No108) was given nine, failing to win a single match before being cut adrift in 2010 amid accusations of a lack of effort.

Before A-Bog strode the outside courts, there was Sam Smith, who wore the title of women’s British No1 like an albatross. Smith lost in the first round in 1989, 1990 and 1991 before taking three years out to earn a history degree. On her return, Smith lost her first match in 1996 – where she admitted to feeling “freaked out” by the crowd’s support – and again in 1997.

Smith returned to Wimbledon in 1998 still a virtual unknown, but got off the mark with two solid wins. In the second round, she thrashed Mariana Díaz Oliva 6-3, 6-1, but injured an ankle, hobbling into her press conference on crutches. It seemed Smith’s upturn in fortune would be brief, especially when in the next round, 1994 winner Conchita Martínez took a 4-1 overnight lead.

On the middle Saturday, the British No1 returned to a half-empty Court 2. Nobody, including Smith, expected an upset – but after losing the first set, she found her groove to level the match. As the third set progressed, the stands filled up dramatically, Smith pouncing in the 12th game to send the former champion out.

“You win a tennis match and suddenly you’re on the front page of a national newspaper,” Smith said the next day, nonplussed by her overnight fame. This aversion to the limelight returned on Court No1 two days later, Smith collapsing to defeat against Nathalie Tauziat, who went on to reach the final. Now a successful commentator and pundit, at least her 15 minutes of fame cured Smith of her stage fright.

5) Zheng Jie (2008)

As a child growing up in China, Zheng Jie fell in love with tennis. When her parents tried to steer her towards a more academic pursuit, her coach offered some words of wisdom – many people in China read books, but few are national heroes. Zheng repaid her coach’s faith, carving out a modest career on the singles tour, but her real breakthrough came in doubles, winning the Wimbledon title alongside childhood playing partner Yan Zi. That result may have been in the minds of the All-England Club when they handed Zheng a wildcard in 2008.

The Joy of Six: great Wimbledon finals Read more

Zheng was world No133 after a year out with ankle problems. The experience affected her profoundly, and for the rest of her career she carried a small piece of her ankle bone in her kit bag. It proved quite the talisman as she upset Dominika Cibulkova before narrowly defeating Elena Baltacha.

In the third round, the diminutive wildcard faced No1 seed Ana Ivanovic. Zheng’s height and fight were her key weapons – her low groundstrokes skidding awkwardly and her regimented returns drawing a hail of unforced errors. Zheng cruised to a 6-1, 6-4 win and Ivanovic, the rising star of women’s tennis, never recovered. Zheng wasn’t finished there, seeing off Agnes Szavay and Nicole Vaidisova to reach the semi-finals, a record for a female wildcard. She was breaking new ground in China too, with nine-figure TV audiences tuning in to see the country’s first singles slam contender.

Serena Williams promptly crushed the fairytale, winning 6-2, 7-6, and Zheng’s career fell back into a mediocre groove. It was what she did off the court that cemented her status back home. Her province of Sichuan was struck by a catastrophic earthquake two months before Wimbledon; Zheng gave all her prize money to the appeal fund.

6) Jonathan Marray & Frederik Nielsen (2012)

Jonathan Marray is a forgotten man of Britain’s 21st century tennis revival. A doubles specialist, he helped Britain vault into the World Group but was a distant memory by the time they won the Davis Cup. This unassuming professional did at least create a piece of British tennis history in 2012.



Jonny Marray: 'I take great confidence from the fact I have won a slam' Read more

While Andy Murray was preparing for another fortnight under the national gaze, his near-namesake was almost cut adrift by an admin error. Partner Adil Shamasdin was not registered in time to take up their wildcard offer, so Denmark’s Frederik Nielsen – friend, fellow Liverpool fan and reluctant doubles player – stepped in.

Marray’s and Nielsen’s run to the final was built on an unrehearsed, alchemic ability to steal close encounters. Three of their first four matches were won in five sets, where they played eight tie-breaks; twice they won the deciding set in the 12th game. Against the all-conquering Bryan brothers, they sealed their place in the final in a dramatic fourth-set breaker.

From nowhere, Marray had the chance to earn immortality; Wimbledon hadn’t seen a home win in the men’s doubles for 76 years. No5 seeds Robert Lindstedt and Horia Tecau stood in the way. The first two sets were shared, before the home favourites edged ahead in – you guessed it – a tie-breaker. Another fourth-set breaker looked like delivering destiny – until Lindstedt and Tecau took it.

A familiar sense of dread swept around Centre Court, but Marray and Nielsen held their nerve. On championship point, a big serve from the former and a clinical volley from the latter sealed an improbable triumph, and wrote this curious partnership into the history books.

As with so many wildcards, the high didn’t last. Nielsen decided he still didn’t rate doubles, and Marray found himself overlooked for a place at the London Olympics. He could at least console himself with the £130,000 winners’ cheque – four times what he made in 2011. Sometimes, it’s not all about the romance.

On Saturday the Royal London One-Day Cup final takes up its new place in the calendar, leaving more than 50 years of memorable September finals for the annals of history

Special September days

On Saturday, Nottinghamshire and Surrey face off for the Royal London One-Day Cup, as the final takes up its new place in the calendar on the first day of July, leaving more than 50 years of (mostly) September finals for the annals of history. Knockout cricket, and the competition’s autumnal climax, was rapturously received when it was launched in 1963. When Sussex beat Worcestershire by 14 runs with 10 balls to play to win the first final, the Guardian’s Geoffrey Nicholson enthused: “Lord’s couldn’t remember anything like it. The tickets had been sold out completely: something virtually unknown for a domestic match. Spectators wore coloured rosettes and favours. There was continuous cheering and singing from the Tavern.”

The following year, Sussex won again. Their captain, Ted Dexter, would have chosen to bat had he won the toss. Instead, he lost it, was ordered to field and the ball duly hooped around for the first couple of hours before the sun came out. “The best things about the day were the weather and the sight of a great ground so well filled, so late in the year,” wrote the Times. “There was an atmosphere of companionship and amity, and of expectancy early on that compensated for the one-sidedness of the match. We had seen again the snags and problems of the one-day match. Like all games of cricket the interest can never be ensured. But thanks are due to the sponsors for their welcome gift to the summer calendar.”

The date’s popularity with supporters made it impervious to criticism, wrote John Arlott, then the Guardian’s chief cricket correspondent, after that match. “Knockout cricket can never be real cricket,” he wrote. “It is a contradiction of the game when the fielding side do better to confine their opponents to 100 for no wicket than to bowl them out for 101. But to fill Lord’s on a Saturday in the football season is a mighty argument for it.”

When Nottinghamshire proposed a restructuring of the season in 1967 that would have involved the Gillette Cup final being shifted to an earlier date, the popularity of its September denouement was the main reason why it was emphatically voted down, by 13 votes to four.

Sky cricket-rights duel with BT to yield over £1bn with BBC set for live return Read more

One-day cricket in September brought with it some unusual challenges and it took everyone a few years to get used to them. In year one Sussex won the toss, batted first and won; in year two Warwickshire won the toss, batted first and lost; in year three, Surrey won the toss, fielded first and lost, and in year four Warwickshire won the toss, fielded first and won. That was all possible coin-toss/decision/outcome combinations covered in the minimum possible time.

Then things settled down, with rather monotonous results. Between 1969 and 2006 – the year before the competition was renamed the Friends Provident Trophy and the final played for a few years at least in mid-August – the winners of the toss fielded first 31 times, winning 71% of those games, and batted first on seven occasions. In the 10 years from 1986 the winners of the toss fielded first eight times and won them all, and batted first twice, losing both.

“It’s all a bit strange when everyone talks in the buildup about how you must win the toss,” the Warwickshire captain Neil Smith said after defeat against Essex in 1997. “This is supposed to be a showpiece final, but at 10.30 in the morning any pitch will do a bit off the seam.”

Mike Selvey, of the Guardian, wrote of that match that “as a spectacle, like so many of its predecessors, it was a disaster”.

“The toss yet again proved decisive. September dew and the 10.30am start are the excuses used in mitigation, but yesterday, for good measure, Warwickshire were outplayed in all departments. However, the groundsman Mick Hunt has to take some responsibility for producing pitches which in successive seasons have deprived 28,000 people, paying in excess of £1m, a total of 66 overs of cricket out of a maximum 240.”

Seven years earlier this advantage had been seen at its most glaring. Lancashire won the toss, put Northampton in, and Phil DeFreitas proceeded to take the first five wickets within the first hour, at a cost of 9 runs. “In theory the toss should not give an advantage,” Selvey wrote. “In practice, at Lord’s in September anyway, this is rarely the case. Much is made of the 10.30 start, and of course it has a bearing. But there is no excuse this summer for a pitch to contain the degree of moisture and exhibit quite the movement that this consistently showed. The game should be a struggle in the first hour, but not conclusively so. The power given by the coin is reducing the final as a contest to the level of the bingo hall.”

Perhaps then it is a surprise that it took another 20 years after that Warwickshire defeat by Essex for the final to be definitively and emphatically moved from the September home it has occupied for most of the 54 years it has, in various guises, survived. In 2007 and 2008 it was played in mid-August, in 2009 on 25 July, and since then it has been played between 15 and 21 September.

Bad weather was an issue surprisingly infrequently. Besides, in England no date is guaranteed to be entirely rain‑free. There was a semi-final between Middlesex and Somerset in August 1977 that was abandoned after three days of solid rain and rescheduled for the following Wednesday, the day before the final Ashes Test was to get under way at The Oval, allowing England’s Mike Brearley and Ian Botham to turn out. But it was rained off then as well, and again on the Thursday. That evening the captains agreed that if no play was possible on the Friday the tie would be decided on the toss of a coin. After a bit of rain in the morning, and with more expected in the afternoon, the sides squeezed in a quick 15-over match, won by Middlesex. “The whole thing typifies my life – it was a complete farce,” said Brian Close, the losing captain.

This was the start of a couple of seasons for Somerset to which the word dramatic could scarcely do justice. In 1978 they entered the Gillette Cup final as overwhelming favourites to beat Sussex, and having never won a major trophy in their entire history were expected to win two in a single weekend, leading the Sunday League by four points (the reward for a victory) with a game to play. On the Saturday Sussex won the toss, fielded first (inevitably) and after scoring 14 runs from Imran Khan’s opening over Somerset managed eight from the next six and lost in the end by five wickets. The following day they lost against Essex by two runs and were pipped at another post. “So much talent, such marvellous support, and nothing for us in the end,” complained Brian Rose, their new captain. “We feel we deserved at least one title.”

The following year they were infamously expelled from the Benson & Hedges Cup for declaring having scored one run after a single over, an attempt to protect their run rate. But the ensuing furore galvanised them. “It drew us together because everybody made the decision,” said Rose. “On the other hand if it had been made by just one person, then it might have split us.”

Chanderpaul in the pink for Lancashire as day-night revolution dawns Read more

In particular, despite the criticism and controversy, the captain found a rich seam of form. “Following the incident Rose strung together a chain of fifties, and was even known to air some cover‑drives, a novel development,” wrote Scyld Berry, again in the Guardian. “In all competitions he has scored more than 2,000 runs. Moreover, his golf has been transformed.”

This time they did win the Gillette Cup and Sunday League in the space of 48 hours, beating Northamptonshire at Lord’s – Viv Richards scoring a brilliant 117, “pushing the ball off his legs as one would knock the ash off a cigarette,” according to Sir Len Hutton – and then outfoxing Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge the following afternoon while Kent, who had been leading the table, lost unexpectedly (it was quite the season for teams whose trophy cabinets had previously been bare: the only other one, Essex, won the County Championship and the Benson & Hedges Cup).

This year’s remodelled domestic calendar has been widely welcomed and may well, as Andrew Strauss predicted when it was announced last March, “create a better narrative to the summer”. But it is worth remembering a time when a few days in early September could conjure up all the narratives any spectator could need.

The seven-time world snooker champion talks his poker face, his golf handicap, Alex Higgins, Neutral Milk Hotel and why he never felt sorry for the Whirlwind

Hello Stephen! Small Talk isn’t good at much, goodness knows, but we like to think we can read a face. You’re a big poker fan, we’re guessing? It’s written all over your coupon! Yeah I am. I began playing during the boom when online poker first started around 2001. I played a lot. Steve Davis got me into it. I saw him doing it on his laptop all the time. We used to have a little school at night. A few players got into it. That’s how I learned to play.

Are you any good? I’ve certainly improved, there’s no doubt about that. You get sick of handing over money! But I wouldn’t say I’m a expert by any stretch of imagination. It’s a bit like chess to me: I know what the pieces do, but playing it well is the hard thing. But I enjoy it, and my association with Poker Stars is great. I’m an ambassador for them, and get to play at these massive events like the Marbella Poker Festival. It’s cool.

You were famous for your inscrutability when you were racking up all those world snooker titles. Is that a skill you can transfer to poker? I think you can certainly have the mindset of an individual sportsman, and knowing when is the right time to be aggressive. Temperament is also important, being able to hold yourself under pressure. I’ve no doubt the very best poker players would know what cards I have in my hands from my reaction! But I try to not give much away, and use that so-called poker face I had on the snooker table.

That poker face looked like it came completely naturally. Small Talk [Small Talk’s cheeks and eyebrows begin twitching nervously] doesn’t have a poker face at all. Are there tips you could give us, to calm the nerves the next time we’re playing our granny at snap? I think temperament is a very hard thing to teach. You have to have that. In any individual sport, I think everyone could be the world champion in anything: it’s the fact that so few can do it under pressure. It’s the difference between being the best and being an also-ran. Even as a junior, I was always able to play my best snooker on the biggest occasion, when there was most pressure. I could switch on and find another gear.

Elise Christie: 'It was easier to hide from stuff before social media' Read more

So did you know from the get-go that you were going to make it? I certainly wouldn’t say so in the beginning, when I was 15 or 16. If someone said you were going to win seven world titles, I would have said they were mad, partly because Scotland had no history of having anyone successful at snooker. I turned pro at 16 and won the world championship at 21. I was able to play under the best conditions. And that’s one of the reasons I turned professional so young, because if I’d stayed an amateur – which I could have done – I didn’t enjoy playing in those surroundings as much. I liked playing in the big time.

Who were your early heroes? When I first started playing, when I was 13 or 14 and watching on TV, my favourite player was Jimmy White. I loved the way he played the game. But when I turned professional and had notions of success, there was only one man to look at and emulate, and that was Steve Davis. Not in terms of technique, but I just loved that he played to win. And even when he won a tournament, he wanted to win the next one and next one and next one. It was a case of never being satisfied.

There’s a lot of Jimmy White in your game: spectacular potting, fast break building, amazing cue-ball control. In Small Talk’s book, you don’t get the credit you deserve for being as exciting as you were. I think I had a new way of playing the game. Get in early, go for your shots, and you’ll win the frame. I just wanted to get in and win. I was fearless. In those days I just went for it. I would see the shot, the way to win the frame, and that was it. If people say the game has changed because of the way I had played it, then I’m very happy with that.

Obviously you wanted to win as many world titles as possible. But do you ever feel sad that Jimmy White never won one? No! No, no, no. This is sport. If you haven’t got what it takes to get over the line, then that’s your fault. I’m not going to feel sorry for anyone.

Did you ever feel sorry for yourself, sitting in the chair while someone else was racking up a big break? It’s what sets snooker apart from any other sport. You’re absolutely trapped, there is no other sport like it. It’s a horrible feeling. Especially if you’ve got in and made a break, then made a mistake, and you’re watching your opponent clear up. It’s absolutely devastating! That’s the hard bit, keeping your emotions in control. But it’s what you have to do as a snooker player.

Did I ever feel sorry for Jimmy White? No! If you haven’t got what it takes, then that’s your fault

Do you think snooker has lost something since its pomp in the 70s, 80s and 90s? Yeah, it’s definitely not as popular as it was in those times. You’re never going to get that again, partly because there are more TV channels, and a bigger selection of sport to choose from. You don’t see it in the newspapers as much, either. But it’s still very popular, there’s no doubt about it. The next world championship final sold out the day after this one finished; people still want to watch. But perhaps it’s not as much in the mainstream.

Do you think anyone will ever beat your record of seven world titles? It’s going to be very tough. Mark Selby has only won three, so it’s going to be very difficult, though I can see him dominating for many years to come. There are players that can win tournaments, but no-one doing it consistently like he is. But even saying that, it’s going to be tough for him, I struggle to see him winning five more.

When you travelled the world as a snooker pro, did you get time to look around the cities you were visiting, or did you just see the inside of the tournament arena? You can do if you want but I never chose to. . My first trip to China was 1987. Did I want to see the wall? I couldn’t be bothered going. Which is pretty bad. I’ve never been a touristy person. When I was there for a tournament, I played the tournament. More often than not, I’d go home the next day.

So when you’re on holiday, you don’t have a checklist of things you have to see? Restaurants and bars, yes! But not sights.

If you locked all the past and current pros in a room and told them to start fighting, who would be the last man standing? And you’re not allowed to take in cues. I suppose Jimmy White would do it. He’d grown up on the streets of London, he’s very streetwise. It would be hard to get past him.

Eddie Charlton was a boxer, wasn’t he? Oh yes, and also Mark Williams had a boxing career when he was young, though you’d be forgiven for thinking he couldn’t fight his way out of a paper bag! And Cliff Thorburn gave Alex Higgins a couple of digs. He’d be up there as well, he’s a tough guy. Higgins wasn’t much of a fighter, though. He’d go in and throw the grenade, then get out of there. He’d start the trouble and let everyone else get on with it!

Did you have any run-ins with the Hurricane? Not really. He once said a few things after he beat me that you couldn’t print in a family newspaper! He had his moments with everybody, but he was great. He was fantastic when I turned professional at 16, he used to bring me to events to practice with him, and I learnt so much from him. It was great, he was a genius.

You’re a handy golfer, too, aren’t you? I’m an eight or nine handicap. There’s a few snooker players better than me, though. John Parrott is one-point-something, he’s a proper golfer. Shaun Murphy is down to about four or five. There are a few low single-figure golfers.

Are potting and putting transferable skills? Only in the respect of the cue action, but that’s where the similarity ends, because you’re looking down on the ball rather than looking along the shot. And the green isn’t level as well, where a snooker table is. So that’s different.

Do you suffer the yips? Putting is the worst part of my game. I played yesterday and I think I three-putted about 12 greens. I stopped counting, it was bad!

You’re a big football fan as well. I like my football. I was a Hearts supporter growing up, but I wouldn’t go back now. What is there to watch in Scottish football? I’ve sort of liked Chelsea since Claudio Ranieri was the manager there, I thought he was a character. I certainly wouldn’t call myself a proper fan. People will say I’m a plastic fan, that I only started liking them when they started winning things!

As for Hearts... if Small Talk was to mention Albert Kidd, whose late goals for Dundee cost the Jambos the 1985-86 Scottish title … Oh God. [laughs wearily.] That was horrendous. [Stephen considers facing down those particular demons, then thinks better of it and changes the subject.] I remember my first time at Hearts, I was five years old and my dad took me to some home games. My hero was a guy called Bobby Prentice, who played on the left wing. But at the age of 12 I moved away from Edinburgh, and never went back to see them, really.

What was the last CD you bought? Neutral Milk Hotel, I was recommended it by Neal Foulds. Neal’s got quite good taste in music, he enjoys similar stuff to the things I like. We were at a tournament, working for ITV, sat at the bar afterwards talking about music, and he said you have to get this. It’s an album that just gets to you. It’s excellent.

You’ve never borrowed any Magma, Monsoon Bassoon, or other psych-rock classics from Steve Davis? No, no no no!

But have you been to see the Nugget DJ? I’ve been tempted to. He was on in Sheffield when the world championship was on, and he invited us down. But I couldn’t go.

What’s your favourite biscuit? Marks and Spencer do an extremely chocolately dark-chocolate ginger biscuit.

On the subject of Steve Davis, and indeed biscuits, the man himself years ago voiced serious concerns to Small Talk about the amount of preservatives used to keep said flat, sweet discs shelf-fresh. Do you share his reservations at all? [Enigmatically] Not when it comes to biscuits.

Neal Foulds recommended Neutral Milk Hotel. It's an album that just gets to you

Cheese or chocolate? It’s close but dark chocolate.

If a lion fought a tiger, who’d win? The tiger. He’d grab the lion by the hair.

You’re holding a fantasy dinner party. You’ve got four invites, but you can only ask one snooker player. Who’s breaking bread at your table? Larry David, he’s my hero. I want to be him, I want to act like him, everything. Anthony Bourdain: I enjoy watching his programmes around the world. You’d have to ask Alex Higgins. And another comedian ... Billy Connolly or Eddie Izzard? Let’s say Ricky Gervais.

Would you have a game of poker at the end of the evening? Not with Higgins about. He’d be trouble!

Do you cook yourself? Yes, yes, I love it. I don’t have my own speciality, though. I collect cookbooks and I like to follow a recipe, I wouldn’t venture off piste.

What’s your poison? Wine. Red or white, it doesn’t really matter. Depends on what I’m eating.

Ah yes, the foodie’s response. Who or what would you put in Room 101? People who don’t say thank you when you let them pass in the car. If you wave and they don’t wave back, I like to ostentatiously wave at them, and maybe give them a beep of the horn.

Nick Skelton: 'I landed on my head and broke my neck' | Small Talk Read more

Your favourite TV show? Curb Your Enthusiasm is up there. I liked The Wire. I like cookery programmes. Anthony Bourdain going around the world eating stuff; Rick Stein, he’s another favourite.

What about Man vs Food? Yes, though I prefer the more serious sorts of things. But I will watch it.

What’s your favourite film? The Wolf of Wall Street. That’s one of those films I can watch over and over again.

The last book you read? A cookbook! Reading from cover to cover, I’m not a great reader. This is a shocking admission, but last time I was on holiday I read a book about the Kardashians! It was a very easy read. I wanted a light read! I was on holiday!

What’s your favourite pie filling? Steak.

What sauce do you put on your chips? Just salt and vinegar.

And finally, could you tell us a joke? My granny used to always tell me this one. It’s a Scottish joke. There are two cows in a field. Which one is on holiday? The one with the wee calf.

It literally is the way you tell ‘em. Thanks Stephen, and good luck in Marbella!

Stephen Hendry will take part in PokerStars Festival Marbella from 19-25 June.

Small Talk chews the fat with Steve Davis - and quickly discovers that if the biscuits don't kill him, the milk, steak and kidney pies or water surely will

Hello Steve.

Hello Small Talk.

Let's get the snooker questions out of the way early doors. Who's going to win the World Championship this weekend?

I honestly don't know, Small Talk. There's four left and I think it's either Stephen Hendry, Ronnie O'Sullivan or Matthew Stevens.

Ah, you've really stuck your neck out for us, there, Steve.

I know, but I really do not know who's going to win it. I really have not got a clue. It's nothing personal with Graham Dott, but he's the only one I can't see winning it.

What about Rocket Ronnie's behaviour this week - swearing at pockets and so forth?

Well it seems to happen in all sports now, it's just the way the world's gone. Our Association needs to decide what should be done on a disciplinary level, so everybody knows. We need a code of conduct, which says you're either allowed to swear at the pockets and make rude signs or you're not, so everybody knows where we stand.

It's just harmless fun, no?

Well it's not for me to say one way or the other, Small Talk, I think it's something the World Snooker Association needs to decide.

Right, on to the big issues. What's your favourite biscuit?

[The line goes silent for several seconds, though a faint tapping sound can be heard]

You're struggling on the biscuit question...

I am, yeah... I'm going to have to come back to you on this one. It's just too early, I've just had breakfast and it's the last thing I fancy at the moment...

OK, we can come back to i...

I used to like Garibaldis, but I've not had one for years. Actually, I'd have one of those now if you've got any.

Alas not, Steve. Sorry.

I think biscuits have gone down hill generally though. They've got far more poisons in them than they used to have.

Like what, arsenic?

No, no, but the stuff they put in them can't be good for you. I think a lot of them have far too long a shelf life for my liking. I like a fresh biscuit with all natural ingredients in but I'm not sure you get them any more. If you can, I'm not sure where you'd get them from... [tails off, sounding genuinely troubled].

Who or what would you put into Room 101?

Erm, [tap, tap] polystyrene cups for drinking tea out of.

Any reason?

Well I'm sure you end up drinking a certain amount of polystyrene every time you have a cup, and that can't be good for you either, can it?

Probably not. You're sounding slightly paranoid, Steve.

Yeah, probably to some degree. But it's a worry what we're fed, isn't it? That's why I make sure I have me bacon and eggs every day [laughs].

Do you wear slippers?

Eh? Oh no. I've got a pair but they're lost in the house somewhere. They're actually a very nice pair - plain black leather. You'd probably describe them as the Rolls Royce of slippers, Small Talk.

So why don't you wear them?

Because they're more suited to a class of people that I've never associated with. They should really be worn with a really good dressing gown and a cravat, and I have neither gown nor cravat. I can't do them justice, so I don't even try.

What was the last record or CD you bought?

Ooh, I bought a soul 45 off the internet, I can't remember what that was called and it hasn't turned up yet. And I re-bought a load of Caravan albums on CD. They're as good as ever, and they were worth buying just for For Girls Who Grow Plump In The Night.

You're not wrong.

You've never heard it, have you?

Erm, no.

Well you ought to. Go and buy it, it's a f-ing brilliant record. An absolute monster.

Kylie or Britney?

Erm, erm, [tap, tap] I'll say Kylie, but I haven't got a clue why. [Tappity tap] She did a very good version of Eartha Kitt's Santa Baby. But the other one [Britney]... I'm not too sure. [Sounds stumped] I honestly don't know much about them, Small Talk [laughs].

What's your favourite TV show?

Er, Poker Million. Friday nights, runs until July.

Shameless, Steve. What's your favourite TV show that you're not in?

Oh, you should have said. Erm... [sounds troubled]... [umms and ahhs for an age]... well I've got all the DVDs of Coupling. Will they do?

If you like watching a poor man's Friends...

No, I think it's the other way round. Even though the Americans make some very funny comedies, I still think when you get a brilliant British one, it's appeals far more to our sense of humour.

How much does a pint of milk cost? [Answer: 40-odd-p]

Oh God, I haven't got a clue. Erm, 59p?

59p? They're squeezing you dry, Steve...

Well I get it from Marks & Spencer. They must use better cows, or something...

If a lion fought a tiger behind the bike sheds, who would win?

Er... the lion? I haven't got a clue [again sounds puzzled]. He's king of the jungle, isn't he?

Indeed he is, so that'll do. Cheese or chocolate?

Ooh that's another tough one, isn't it. [More tapping]. I like them both but I'd have to go with a very strong cheddar or some quality brie. But if you're talking chocolate, it's have to be the [tap, tap]... the erm [tap, tap]... the 85% Lindt. Two squares of that and you need at least three pints of water.

Not tap water though, that could kill you.

Good point.

Thanks. What colour underpants are you wearing today?

I have a stripey pair of sort of greyey-blue boxer shorts on. They're not designer pants, no. They're just from a pack of three.

Own any lucky pants?

No, but I've got a lucky pair of shoes. I've worn them for the last 10 years but as I haven't f**king won a match for ages I'm not sure I'll continue wearing them. They don't wear out 'cos I only play in them, but one's got a big dent in the front from when I must have kicked a door or something.

What's your poiso... drink?

I like a nice Shiraz.

Ever drunk so much you've forgotten your name?

Erm, I drunk a lower grade of it on the night I got beat at this year's World Championship and although I didn't quite forget my name, I did end up shouting out of our hotel room for Ralph and Huey.

What, you were sick out the window? Rock and roll!

No, not actually out of the window, I was down on my hands and knees on the floor. Woke up the next morning with a big headache, but no rubbish wine in my system.

Phew, etc. What was the last book you read?

The Many-coloured Land by Julian May, a science fiction book. I've read it two or three times and keep going back because it's quite fascinating and I keep meaning to familiarise myself before reading the next one. There are three more in the series, and I'll tell you what, Small Talk, it knocks seven bells out of Lord Of The Rings.

Speaking of which, have you ever knocked another man out?

Yes, in the first round at the Crucible.

Yes, very good. But what about with your fists or a stick?

Oh no. I don't really have any muscles in my body capable of doing anything like that and I've certainly never used an implement.

Ever kicked another man in the groin?

No, I've avoided physical contact throughout the whole of my life.

What's your favourite pie filling?

Pie filling? [Small Talk nods, Steve appears to ignore the question in favour of more tapping before finally]... steak and kidney, I think.

You think? Surely the King Of Pies!

Yeah, but it's got to be home-made, Small Talk.

Need I ask why?

Because I think if it's home-made you can have every confidence that there's nothing dodgy in it.

...

You can never be sure, Small Talk. At least with my wife's pie I know what's gone in it.

Erm, tea or coffee?

Tea [tap, tap]. I usually go for Marks & Spencer's tea in the gold packet. I can't be any more specific than that, I'm afraid. [Tap] It's normal tea, though, none of that poncey rubbish.

Milk and sugar?

Just milk. Full fat, none of the poisons of skimmed that nobody knows about yet.

Eh?

It's true. The process they use to skim it produces very small fat globules, which are more dangerous than proper fat. Skimmed milk is no good for you. It's far worse than full fat, which admittedly isn't good for you either, but it's less harmful.

Are you sure?

Absolutely. Give it five years and they'll probably be writing pieces in the Daily Mail health bit about it.

You've got Small Talk worried now...

Do you dunk your biscuits in your tea?

Whenever possible.

Then you're history, Small Talk. You won't make the 2009 World Championship at this rate, so you won't be around to do this same interview with Ronnie.

But what a way to go: poisoned by skimmed milk.

Well yeah, it's not a bad way to go.

Erm, where are you off to?

Back to the internet to play some more online poker.

Ah, that explains the tapping and loss of concentration then...

Oh sorry, Small Talk. I'm multi-tasking, clicking and talking. I'm very advanced. Hang on, I must have won money without realising. It says here I'm 50 cents up!

Well done. It's been an enlightening and frightening pleasure, Steve.

No problem, Small Talk, thanks very much. Just watch what you eat and drink, that's all I'm saying.

Steve Davis will be covering the World Championships on the BBC this weekend, and he's also involved with the launch of World Championship Snooker 2004 on PlayStation and Xbox, which is out on June 25. For more details, visit www.codemasters.co.uk/snooker2004.

A search of the patents registered in the second half of the 19th century by Moses G Crane of Massachusetts reveals a man who was never short of ideas. There is an egg-beater, an ice-cream freezer, a method of making pliers, a restyled bicycle, an electro-mechanical gong and a gun-barrel scraper. There are also several versions of and adjustments to his most lasting contribution to society, the fire alarm, the success of which provided him with enough money to pursue one of his more far-fetched flights of fancy.

The forgotten story of ... Carlos Kaiser, football's greatest conman | Rob Smyth Read more

Crane had three sons who played football at Harvard, but he was not a fan of the sport. Apparently he believed that “to the average person without a college education it is incomprehensible, dull, cruel”, and he was particularly irritated at how hard it was to follow the progress of a small brown ball on a crowded, and often quite brown, field. And so Crane donned his thinking cap. “If the ball were only made large,” he said, “yes, large enough so that a player on one side could not see who was on the other, you would then have a chance to interest spectators in watching the whole game and in introducing much merriment, as well as skill.” In 1894 he found someone who could make his monster ball, at a cost – for materials alone – of some $175, about $4,500 in today’s money, and after several months of experimentation his son Edwin produced some rules. Pushball was born.



The following year it was mentioned for the first time in the British press, with several papers carrying news of the new “Yankee invention”. “The new game has some of the essential features of football, but possesses many original points,” they wrote. “The ball itself is a great curiosity. It can be moved with very slight pressure – indeed, a good wind will send it rolling across the field at a lively rate.” The only thing stopping the game spreading in popularity was the somewhat limiting fact that there was only one ball in existence. But like Crane himself, some people saw the absence of something as an opportunity. EV Hanegan, a British entrepreneur, read about the sport, thought it might just catch on in his homeland, and started planning.

“Pushball is a game for giants. Such a game as the gods on Olympus might have played without great loss of dignity,” Hanegan wrote. “In Connecticut, where the game found its first popularity, they despise parlour games, and when the monster push-ball was invented the strenuous athletes found it just the thing to give them the real exercise that they hungered for in games, and they hailed push-ball with acclamations. Now the game is one of the joys of life to the youth of New England.”

Eight years after its invention, pushball arrived in Britain. On 23 August 1902 it was played in public for the first time, in front of 4,004 curious souls at Headingley and using a 6ft ball constructed from the hides of nine horses, which took two and a half hours to inflate using a specially-modified pump. In brief, the game involved two teams of eight men trying to shove a giant ball over their opponents’ goal-line, with bonus points for getting it between the goalposts (the crossbar having been removed for practical reasons). Hanegan distributed leaflets among the crowd, suggesting that “league and rugby clubs will play this game throughout the summer months, thus keeping their players in the pink of condition”.



Reviews were mixed. The Yorkshire Post said it “has many features of interest” and that though it “is not as exciting as football, because the ball cannot be moved so quickly, there is nevertheless a fair scope for science and skill”. The Leeds Mercury, however, was sceptical. “The game was described in the leaflets as ‘exciting, laughable, skilful and entertaining’. Now that, of course, is how they view it in the land of ‘tall orders’. In this country we should put it a little less glowingly. It is not so attractive as cricket, so varied and surprising as football, nor so fatuous as ping-pong. But it has something of all these qualities, though chiefly it is notable for lack of incident.” The reviewer admitted that when a team managed to bear the ball above them towards their opponents’ goal “it was pretty to watch” and “the crowd cheered, delighted”, but concluded that though “once in a season pushball might do, the Americans have nothing to teach us in outdoor games”.

From there the giant ball went on a nationwide tour, taking in Hull, Halifax, Middlesbrough, Newcastle, Sheffield, Glasgow and Cork, and attracting thousands of people on each occasion. “If the ball comes into antagonism with a player, which it does pretty often in the course of a game, the individual concerned has substantial cause to remember the encounter,” noted the Hull Daily Mail. “The ball bounces, but not as much as the players opposed to it. It appeared to be possessed with the idea that the game was that of nine-pins, and that its mission on earth was to skittle the greatest possible number of artistes helter-skelter, head over heels, in the least possible time. It was no uncommon thing to see it upset three or four at a sweep.” But they, too, were sceptical of the game’s merits. “There appears to be little scope for individual skill, and intelligence is not greatly in demand,” they concluded. “From a spectator’s standpoint it is often laughable, but slow and clumsy.”

Gradually however it found national attention. At the end of August the Daily Mail wrote about a game that “seems to combine science and hard work – extremely hard work – more effectively than any game yet designed”. The Guardian noted that “to play the game properly and to be able to keep up with the pace, which is necessarily fast, a player must be capable of a good deal of physical endurance”. One of the men who had played at Headingley told the Yorkshire evening post that “I had much rather play Association football. Pushball may be all right for the spectators, but it is terrifically hard work for the players.”

That September the national tour concluded with a showpiece finale in London, on the Crystal Palace pitch that hosted the FA Cup final. “Pushball describes itself exactly: two teams take a ball and push it. Obviously that side which is the most pushful wins,” wrote the Guardian. “It is part of the game that certain members of a team should lie down in front of the ball when it is being pushed towards their goal – an action which is partly sacrificial and partly defiant, as though they, like heroes of melodrama, proclaimed, ‘only over our prostrate forms shall you accomplish your base desires’. On Saturday most of the spectators came to scoff and saw no reason for a more amiable attitude.”

There was some confusion when the game was played in New York for the first time, on Thanksgiving Day 1902, and local newspapers described it as “the new English game”, leading others back in Britain to wonder if they had been in some way hoaxed. The New York debut did not go at all well: the organisers failed to locate a pushball, so on the eve of the tournament asked a local shoemaker to create one. This they did, on the same field on which it was to be played with the following afternoon, sewing leather into an approximate sphere and stuffing it with hay. Having done so, however, they found it was too big to fit through the gate and back out of the field, so it had to be left there overnight. Inevitably, rain fell. The following day the 50lb ball had soaked up so much water it weighed more like 500lb, and “after the first half the contestants became so tired that the contest was called a draw”.

Soon a cunning method of making the sport less physically taxing was discovered: playing pushball on horses. In 1904 Edward VII took in a match, and the Guardian described “a game likely to create as strong an interest in his subjects as it did with the King, who rose from his seat and followed the movements with visible enthusiasm”. The Times, in their report on the same event, wrote that there was “no longer any room for doubt that the pushball on horseback is not only the success of the Military tournament, but also the beginning of a game which is likely to be taken up widely. It is intensely amusing to watch; the horses get more clever at it every day.”

Mounted pushball became a staple of military tournaments for a while, joining such disciplines as lemon-cutting (using swords to slice through fruit set on poles while galloping), tent-pegging (riders with lances gallop down a field attempting to spear pegs and carry them away), the balaclava melee (mounted soldiers trying to knock plumes from each other’s helmets) dummy-thrusting (the bayoneting of stuffed dummies) and the deliciously offensive Cleaving the Turk’s Head (slashing at stuffed balloons on poles). Further variations were attempted, including skate pushball, motor pushball – propelling the ball using modified cars – and aviation pushball, which sadly did not involve aeroplanes, but was instead a kind of cross between polo, pushball, volleyball and tennis, and at least as confusing as it sounds.



Eventually the cavalry was canned, and interest in the game deflated. Pushball fell back into obscurity, receiving increasingly irregular mentions in the Guardian until the early 1930s. Perhaps it was simply too taxing, and too dangerous. One of its final appearances in this paper came in 1927, when the Duke of York joined in a game while visiting a holiday camp in New Romney. “The Duke was among those who were bowled over now and again,” we reported. “He took it good-humouredly, and at the close of the play was taken to hospital to have a slight injury on his elbow treated. His secretary also underwent treatment to a slight injury to his knee.”

World champion Peter Sagan has been disqualified from the Tour for causing the crash on stage four involving Mark Cavendish. At the end of a largely uneventful stage, Sagan cut across Cavendish’s racing line and nudged him with an elbow to cause the Manx sprinter to hit the side barriers hard. Sagan won stage three and came second here, but will play no further part in this year’s Tour

Both Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic had early finishes in their first round matches, with both men’s opponents retiring after around 40 minutes. The women’s No1 Angelique Kerber was tested rather more, being made to work hard to secure a 6-4, 6-4 win over Irina Falconi

On the first day of Wimbledon, Britain’s Andy Murray and Johanna Konta were among the names to successfully negotiate their first round matches. Petra Kvitova continued her recovery since she was attacked by a burglar in her home and Venus Williams won in straight sets before breaking down in tears at her press conference

~~

Andy Murray is up and running at Wimbledon – with just a hint of a carthorse hobble – and, after an highly entertaining win against the world No135, Alexander Bublik, on Centre Court, declared himself “really positive” about defending his title. However, the man who some thought might challenge him for his No1 crown, the fifth seed, Stan Wawrinka, was knocked out in the first round by Daniil Medvedev in four sets.

“First match at a slam, there’s always a few extra nerves,” Murray said after winning 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 on day one in an hour and 44 minutes in which the sore hip that interrupted his preparation last week appeared to hold up under the pressure of countering a carefree young opponent who constantly switched the direction and depth of his groundstrokes.

Murray, who plays the similarly unorthodox Dustin Brown in the second round on Wednesday, added: “Once I got out there and got the early break, saved a few break points in my first service game, I felt good. Considering how I was feeling five, six days ago, it was really positive.”

Andy’s welcome return enhances pleasure of Wimbledon’s day-tripping ultras | Barney Ronay Read more

He did appear to walk stiffly between points, though, and said: “I don’t know if that’s something that’s come over the last couple of weeks when my hip’s been sore. I’ve always done it and everyone is sort of saying that I’m walking that way because of my hip. I’m not in a lot of pain when I’m walking, that’s for sure. I’m certainly not hurting between the points. My hip felt good. It’s a little bit sore but I was moving really good today.”

Murray revealed that he and Bublik, a 20-year-old part-time rapper from St Petersburg who defected to Kazakhstan for tennis purposes after being denied Russian funding, chatted during a brief rain break at the start of the third set.

“Before I got interviewed by him in Indian Wells earlier in the year [for the ATP website], I asked him how his match had gone. He said: ‘Oh, I served like 20 double faults.’ In the interview he asked me if I had any advice for him. I said, ‘Try not to serve 20 double faults.’

“Then he said to me just before we went on [on Monday]: ‘Yeah, thanks for the advice about not serving 20 double faults.’ I said: ‘You served a few.’ He said: ‘Yeah, I think I’m only on about 10 right now.’ I said: ‘Well, there’s still time to get to 20.’ It was just funny. It’s rare that you speak to someone, like, during a match.”

If that anecdote reflects how relaxed Murray is after a stressful couple of weeks – and a troublesome season of illness, injury and mixed results – he knows the pressure will build. He and Brown – who came from behind to beat the Portuguese João Sousa in four sets – have played only once, when Murray defeated him at the US Open seven years ago. “He plays a similar way in terms of being pretty unpredictable, going for different shots, a lot of power,” Murray said.

“Dustin plays a lot more up at the net than Bublik. He tends to come out with some great shots. Very entertaining guy to watch. He’s a great mover. Really, really good athlete. He’s a good personality, as well. Always fun, fun guy to watch. We get on well. We message each other from time to time. I like him. He’s really, really a nice guy.

“I expect him to be very aggressive. I think he’ll come forward a lot. He’s unpredictable. You know he’s going to go for it. Also you know he hits a lot of drop-shots. He can play slice. Sometimes he hits two first serves, goes for a huge second serve.” Brown beat Rafael Nadal in the second round in 2015.

Wawrinka was beaten 4-6, 6-3, 4-6, 1-6 by Medvedev and was the second high-profile exit in the men’s draw after Nick Kyrgios retired injured while losing 3-6, 4-6 to Pierre-Hugues Herbert.

Peter Sagan won the third stage of the 2017 Tour de France, while Geraint Thomas retained the yellow jersey. This challenging stage started in Belgium, travelled through Luxembourg and ended by entering France for the first time. On their way, the riders took in a lap of the Spa-Francorchamps, the setting for Formula One’s Belgian Grand Prix

~~

Since 2012 it has become increasingly clear that Peter Sagan is, as the French would say, un cas à part – in a class of his own. In sporting terms, the double world champion appears utterly impervious to pressure and can prove utterly unbeatable on his day, as was the case here in a carbon copy of his victory last year in Cherbourg. It is also true in terms of the image he projects.

Cycling has never seen anyone quite like the Slovak, whose strength cannot be matched in this kind of uphill finish, rising just under 100 metres in two kilometres, after a five-hour slog south, mainly into a headwind. At 300 metres to go, as he wound up for the sprint against Michael Matthews, Greg Van Avermaet, Daniel Martin and Arnaud Démare – all names to be reckoned with on their day – the cleat on his right shoe detached itself from his clipless pedal.

In a flash the Slovak had to fish around with his foot to put it back in the pedal, losing momentum as he did so. He was stalled for less than a second but that should have been more than enough to wreck his chances.

Instead, he got going again and had more than enough to hold off Matthews. “I was lucky to find my pedal again at the right moment, and that the finish was a long way away,” he said.

A few yards behind came a 25-rider group that included pretty much every favourite bar Simon Yates, who managed to get on the wrong side of the split and dropped eight seconds, and also Thibaut Pinot, who had made it known that stage wins and the King of the Mountains prize are his priorities.

Of Chris Froome’s rivals, only Richie Porte showed his hand in any sense, putting in a single impressive burst of speed in the final kilometre, but even so looking as if he was more interested in attempting to enable a stage win for Van Avermaet than trying to snatch a few seconds.

Sagan’s style is uniquely bonkers. On Monday he was channelling both Lemmy from Motörhead (bizarre facial hair) and Anna Wintour (eyes peeking out through vast fringe) plus a set of vast, superfluous goggles around his neck. Who on earth knew why but with Sagan it never seems to matter. He does his own thing on his bike as well, for example using his devastating cornering ability to constantly pile the pressure on the opposition when in a breakaway, or riding with utter clarity of vision in the wind, the key to his defence of his world title last September. If he faces a single issue, it is that he is so good he may easily be taken for granted.

As cycling’s only champion with serious internet and youth appeal, combined with his ability on the bike, he was last year’s transfer prize and he opted to become the centre of a revamped Bora–Hansgrohe team, which he leads with the Pole Rafal Majka. Being his own master rather than banging heads constantly with his previous boss, the Russian Oleg Tinkov, clearly suits him. From being odds-on to take a sixth green jersey that now looks as close to a certainty as anything on two wheels can be.

Froome is equally far from being an Identikit champion. With little fanfare, the triple Tour winner is getting quietly on with his campaign; three days in, it is going to plan apart from any lingering effects of Sunday’s crash, which would have been expected to be felt here. He moved up the standings to second yesterday behind Geraint Thomas and he has an advantage over his opponents which is more than healthy.

Around Team Sky, the topic du jour has moved seamlessly from whether their skin suits might be in breach of the rules to whether the British squad has enjoyed the best Tour start in its eight attempts. They have every reason to be happy, with the closest of Froome’s potential rivals now 33sec behind the triple winner.

On the stage to Vittel on Tuesday the focus switches back to the flat-road sprinters, led by Marcel Kittel, who lost time as expected here and will not challenge Thomas for the yellow jersey. Kittel does not have quite the impregnable air of Sagan, and he faces stiff competition from André Greipel, Mark Cavendish and company, but a second victory will set him up for a dominant run to match Cavendish’s last year.

The British & Irish Lions edged a tense contest in Wellington, with Owen Farrell landing a late penalty to keep the series alive with a 24-21 win over the All Blacks. Despite the historic victory – New Zealand had not lost at home since 2009 – the Lions captain, Sam Warburton, insisted he will only be happy if they clinch the series next week at Eden Park.

~~

Geraint Thomas won the first Grand Tour stage of his career in his eighth Tour de France, with victory in the opening 14km time trial stage in Düsseldorf, Germany. The Team Sky rider finished in 16m 4s, five seconds clear of his closest rivals, to take the yellow jersey

~~

In a soaking chill reminiscent of a summer evening in his valleys of his native land, Geraint Thomas became the first Welshman to wear the yellow jersey of the Tour de France, finishing five seconds ahead of the young Swiss Stefan Küng at the end of the 14 kilometres. That feat in itself would have been enough to get Chris Froome’s quest for a fourth Tour off to a flying start but the triple winner gained significant time on all his rivals.

Thomas’s victory crowns a distinguished career that has included Olympic gold medals in Beijing and London, and it compensated for the unfortunate end to his assault on the Giro d’Italia in May, when he was forced out after a heavy crash involving a motorbike. There had been inevitable questions about his form after that incident but this appears to resolve those doubts. Ironically for a rider who has seen his chances dashed numerous times by ill-timed crashes, and who finished the Tour in 2013 with a broken pelvis, Thomas stayed upright on a day when the wet conditions played a defining role.

The 31-year-old former member of the Maindy Flyers became only the eighth Briton to wear the yellow jersey. He took full advantage of a rising wind that blew a little more strongly against later starters including Küng and the big favourite, the reigning world time trial champion, Tony Martin, who had been expected to deliver a home victory but fell short by eight seconds.

“This is good for my morale and good for the team,” said Thomas, who claimed he was inspired by watching the Lions beat the All Blacks earlier in the day. “I’m buzzing off that, it took my mind off the race. I took the first corner quick, was told to take it easy so took no big risks. I tried to save it for the last four kilometres and couldn’t have gone any better. Froome showed his horsepower, as he was taking it easy on the corners. The goal for the team won’t change, though, it’s all about him so if I have to lose the jersey, so be it.”

Throughout the day, the rain fell on Düsseldorf with gentle relentlessness. The barriers became a sea of umbrellas, the tarmac a treacherous skating rink, turning the stage from a straightforward blast up and down the east bank of the Rhine into the cycling equivalent of Russian roulette. The equation for each of the contenders was simple and brutal: gamble on gaining time on the rest and risk a crash that would at best compromise the first part of the Tour or at worst end it completely.

Froome had followed Thomas in a team car to look over the course one last time; he not only emerged unscathed but gained valuable time on his rivals for the overall classification, even his former team-mate Richie Porte, who lost 35sec to the defending champion. The Australian Porte said afterwards: “I was nervous, tense, super careful on the corners. It wasn’t my best time trial.”

Apart from Froome, most of the favourites finished closely grouped together, indicating that they had all taken the corners at a similar cautious pace. Simon Yates dropped only 25sec in a discipline that he does not regard as his strong suit but Nairo Quintana, Alberto Contador, Thibaut Pinot, Romain Bardet and Jakob Fuglsang finished between 36 and 42 seconds slower than Froome. These are not conclusive gaps – although who knows how tight this year’s Tour will prove to be – but the pressure is on those who want to unseat the Team Sky leader with only 16 minutes raced.

Time-trialling in the wet is difficult enough but on an urban course it can turn into a nightmare. The riders had to contend with lengthy puddles in dips in the tarmac, pedestrian crossings picked out in a type of red-dyed tarmac with all the adhesion of a patch of ice, narrow turns that were hard to read, with soaking, slippery white lines on the entrances and exits. For most of the riders, this was a stage to get through, with the 13 corners to be negotiated with extreme care in the sodden conditions.

The fate of Alejandro Valverde showed the potential cost of a second’s inattention or over-ambition. The near-veteran Spaniard, one of the few survivors of the Operación Puerto blood-bag scandal still racing, had enjoyed a quite brilliant early season and had been expected to be a strong second foil for Quintana in the coming weeks. His Tour came to a sudden halt on day one with a sickeningly heavy fall on the sweeping left-hander off the second bridge over the Rhine with just under seven kilometres to ride. He departed the race with lower leg injuries including a broken knee cap. Another Spaniard, Bahrain-Merida’s 28-year-old Jon Izaguirre, fell on the same corner and was also put out of the race.

Not surprisingly, many were reduced to walking pace as they tried to start their Tours by remaining in one piece. The first to crash was the Dutch sprinter Dylan Groenewegen, followed by his team-mate Primoz Roglic – an outside chance for the stage win; while the Frenchman Tony Gallopin also came a cropper, as did Team Dimension Data’s British Tour debutant Scott Thwaites. Gallopin was taken to hospital with contusions to his shin; Thwaites had merely the usual grazes.

Thomas has enough time in hand on the sprinters to hold the jersey at least as far as Monday’s hilly finish in north-eastern France, but on Sunday he and the others face 203km in the saddle south-west to Liège, largely flat and probably ending in a bunch gallop, where Mark Cavendish will face his first real test after his recovery from glandular fever.

The Henley regatta is an event synonymous with the English social season, both a competitive rowing event and a chance for the well-heeled to don their blazers and frocks for a spot of traditional summer fun.

The rowing course is just over two kilometres long and straddles Buckinghamshire and Berkshire on either side of the Thames.

Lovin’ the crews

Five hundred and seventy-eight crews are entered into the regatta this year. They come from universities, colleges, schools and independent rowing clubs from around the world. Normally more than 100 are from overseas.



The competing boats are prepared for racing in the Boat Tent area.

Competitors make some final adjustments to their boat



A group of spectators are from Pangbourne College, a local boarding and day school.



On the water

From canoes to launches, the best fun seems to be had on the water, away from the exclusive enclosures and expensive bars and rowing clubhouses, where anyone can take their craft through the regatta areas.

For some it’s a chance to get closer to the action, for others it’s a chance to join the parade, or just have a spot of lunch.

Spectators out on the water. Below: Back to dry land after watching the action. Smelvis and the River Boys bring some Memphis flavour to the Thames.



Members only

The exclusive stewards’ enclosure is reserved for members and their guests. Those on the list can watch the racing from the members’ grandstand and the Fawley grandstand. There is even a members-only floating grandstand.

Spectators watch the regatta inside the stewards’ enclosure. Right: Natalie Kernan from Putney and Fi Barnes from Henley.

Drinking and spectating aren’t allowed to mix in the stewards’ enclosure, as, perhaps deliberately, the bar areas don’t face the water.

Racing

The events are grouped into a top, intermediate and lower level for club and student oarsmen. There are also junior events.



On Wednesday and Thursday, crews compete in the heats to qualify for Friday’s quarter finals. The semi final and final races are held over the weekend.

Rowers return from a race.



Crews are assigned to row on either the Bucks or Berks side of the course, and they risk disqualification if they wander to the other side.

Gloriana

Built for the 2012 jubilee, Gloriana was the first royal barge built for over 250 years. It carries 18 oarsmen and was constructed using techniques that have changed little since the clinker-built longboats of the Viking age. The vessel is used to encourage better use of the river and to promote the sport of rowing to young people.

Alan Tucker and Matthew Gordon are members of Kingston rowing club and have had their blazers for 41 years. This year they are crewing Gloriana.

Jockey Michelle Payne speaks to reporters in Melbourne after being suspended for four weeks for taking a banned appetite suppressant. Payne, who returned a urine sample this month containing traces of phentermine, admitted guilt at a Racing Victoria inquiry on Thursday and said she had made a mistake

~~

Michelle Payne accepted complete culpability and was full of remorse after the Melbourne Cup-winning jockey was handed a four-week suspension for testing positive for a banned substance.

Payne, who returned a urine sample this month containing traces of phentermine, admitted guilt at a Racing Victoria inquiry on Thursday and said she had made a mistake.

Melbourne Cup winner Michelle Payne tests positive for banned substance Read more

“I would like to take full responsibility and had I have known it would still be my system, and I would be riding with a banned substance in my system, I wouldn’t be riding,” she said. “I’m embarrassed and I’m sorry for that.”

The 31-year-old was prescribed the drug, an appetite suppressant, as she recovered from surgery on her pancreas last year.



It is an individual rider’s responsibility to ensure any medication taken meets anti-doping criteria. Phentermine appears on the banned list in accordance with Australian Rule of Racing 81B.

She told the hearing she was aware phentermine was on the banned list, but believed its prohibition only applied on race days, and not during trackwork.

Payne’s positive sample was taken at a race meet at Swan Hill on 11 June. She was informed of the result and stood down from racing and trackwork on 23 June, pending the hearing at Flemington.



Given she had already out of the saddle for nearly a week, Payne’s team argued for “time served”, but after deliberation the RV panel opted to impose the month-long sanction from Thursday.

The chair of the inquiry, Robert Cram, said stewards took into account her admission of guilt, regret and medical condition when coming to their verdict.

“However, notwithstanding those factors it is our view that you didn’t comply with your fundamental obligation to seek advice before taking the substance Phentermine,” Cram said.

The ban will end on 21 July, allowing Payne to race in August’s Shergar Cup international jockeys’ challenge at Ascot in the UK. She will be allowed to resume trackwork once she returns a clear urine sample.

Payne underwent surgery to save her pancreas following a serious injury sustained in a fall at Mildura in May 2016. She successfully applied for a trainer’s licence later that year and has since been pursuing a dual career as a jockey and a trainer. Payne now trains a small team of horses from her Ballarat base.

She is not the first high-profile Australian jockey to be handed a ban for testing positive for an appetite supressant – Hugh Bowman, one of the country’s top riders and pilot of the star horse Winx – was banned for six weeks in 2003, and Damien Oliver, the three-times Melbourne Cup winner, was banned for four weeks in 2009. Oliver late had his sanction overturned.

“I appreciate [the ban] is in keeping with other penalties for riders in breach of this rule,” Payne said. “I look forward to working hard and being in great shape upon my return to racing.”

Payne rocketed into the wider public’s consciousness in November 2015 when she guided the 100-1 shot, Prince of Penzance, to Melbourne Cup victory and became the first woman to win Australia’s premier race in its 155-year history.

Shortly after crossing the line, she delivered her famous “everyone else can get stuffed” speech, creating worldwide headlines while shining a light on what she said was a “chauvinistic” sport.

~~

John McEnroe dismissed suggestions that Serena Williams was the best player in the world, arguing that she would ‘be like 700 in the world” if she played on the men’s tour. His comments came during an interview on NPR on Sunday when he was promoting his new memoir. Williams has won 23 grand slam singles titles over the course of her career, the most recent coming at the Australian Open in 2017 when she was already pregnant with her first child.

~~

Usain Bolt wants to ‘enjoy every minute’ of the final phase of his incredible career. Speaking ahead of the Golden Spikes event in Ostrava, one of his final 100m races, the Jamaican eight-time Olympic gold medallist is resolute in his decision to leave the sport at the end of this season, but admits to feeling emotional about it. Having defined the sport during a turbulent era, Bolt also believes that good times are ahead for track and field.

• Cook steps down citing lack of energy, but wants to keep on playing • Strauss says Cook should be looked upon as one of England’s great captains

Alastair Cook ended his reign as England’s longest-serving Test captain and ushered in a new era under his expected successor, Joe Root, after questioning whether he still had the energy to lead the team into next winter’s Ashes.

Cook, 32, had been considering his position since the team’s 4-0 defeat to India before Christmas and on Sunday evening he formally tendered his resignation to ~ Graves, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, before informing the players via email and a series of follow-up phone calls.

Captaincy was duty not art for Alastair Cook, English cricket’s finest servant | The Spin Read more

In calling time on his 59 Tests in charge – a four-and-a-half year spell which featured 24 wins and 22 defeats – Cook stated his intention to continue a career that has reaped 11,057 runs to date, adding: “Stepping down has been an incredibly hard decision but I know this is the correct decision for me and at the right time for the team.”

Cook first met with Andrew Strauss, the director of England cricket, to discuss his future on 13 January but despite being encouraged by his predecessor to take more time to consider his position, the genie was already out of the bottle.

“Alastair felt that a huge amount of energy and drive and commitment was needed to take the England team forward over the next 12 to 18 months and he had some questions in the back of his mind as to how much he had left in the tank,” said Strauss.

“We left that meeting with me urging him to take a bit more time. He contacted me again over the last 10 days and it was clear in his mind that it was the right time for him and the team, and that this was an opportunity to give a new captain time to bed in and establish his method, his way and philosophy.”

Asked if he tried to change Cook’s mind – something the left-handed opener’s mentor, Graham Gooch, attempted at the 11th hour without success – Strauss replied: “We never got to that stage. If a captain is questioning how much he has left in the tank then he is making that decision himself.”

Stuart Broad (@StuartBroad8) Thanks Skip! pic.twitter.com/cvw0oZeaPw

Despite making Root vice-captain in May 2015 and though there are few other alternatives to be captain, Strauss held off from confirming his promotion, instead stating he would hold conversations with the selectors, the coaching staff and senior players before making an announcement before the one-day side depart for the Caribbean on 22 February.

Cook, who won eight and lost just four of his 17 series in charge and whose highlights included two Ashes victories at home in 2013 and 2015, and away successes in India in 2012 and South Africa last year, has previously endorsed Root’s captaincy credentials.

But with only three matches as captain at Yorkshire, and the fact Root will need to juggle his career as a three-format cricketer and a new father, there remain concerns about overburdening the 26-year-old.

The first of seven Tests this summer against South Africa and West Indies is not until 6 July at Lord’s, however, meaning there is time to adjust to the role before forging a side to defend the Ashes in Australia, starting at the Gabba in Brisbane on 23 November.

Alastair Cook named ICC’s Test captain of 2016 but no place for Virat Kohli Read more

Strauss said: “We don’t live in an ideal world in any way, shape, or form and most captains inherit the captaincy when it is not an ideal time. It’s worth saying Joe Root has done a very good job as vice-captain. He’s matured a lot over the last two years and there is absolutely no reason he won’t be one of the strong candidates.”

While Cook’s decision marks the passing of the baton to the next generation in the dressing room – Ben Stokes is tipped to become the new vice-captain – Strauss insisted it did not come down to a clash of philosophies with the head coach, Trevor Bayliss.

He instead praised Cook’s work in aiding the transition of the team that broke up after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash in Australia – a series defeat he will now have to avenge solely as a player – and the resilience shown during the fallout from Kevin Pietersen’s removal.

Strauss said: “I honestly believe he deserves to be looked upon as one of England’s great captains. I also think the great measure of a leader is what the people who played with you and under you feel about you. I’m certain that there isn’t a single player in that dressing room right now who doesn’t think Alastair has done an unbelievable job.”

On Cook’s plans to play on, needing a further 4,865 runs to surpass Sachin Tendulkar’s world record 15,921 in Test cricket, Strauss added: “Without the travails of the captaincy I believe it will freshen him up immensely.

“He’s only 32 years of age, he’s potentially got three or four years at least, so can concentrate on his game and be unshackled. No one needs to talk about how good a player he is.”

The stage is set. The actors primed. At Wimbledon everything has been Championship ready since last Saturday. The grass has been trimmed to precisely 8mm. The flowers are perky and flushed with life. And the food – including 27,887kg of Kent strawberries – is waiting to be plucked, packed and delivered. Now everyone is counting down to the moment that itchy tingle of anticipation morphs into a roar as Andy Murray steps on to Centre Court to defend his title and begin the 131st edition of the greatest tennis tournament in the world.

It seems scarcely believable that the first Wimbledon tournament was held in 1877. Or that it was only held so the All England Club could pay for the repair of the pony roller needed to maintain the lawns. The event attracted 22 players who paid one guinea to enter – and the winner, Spencer Gore, received 12 guineas in prize money and a silver challenge cup. In 2017, the men and women’s singles winners will pocket £2.2m each.

In the intervening 140 years, many of the traditions have stayed largely unaltered. Strawberries, for instance, are synonymous with Wimbledon because the early tournaments coincided with the short summer season. The insistence on predominately white clothes too. Of course its vibe, which describes itself as “tennis in an English country garden”, is still hugely successful. Yet it has also realised that tradition – while important – only gets you so far. And during the past decade or so, Wimbledon has quietly modernised, democratised and been lighter on its feet as it has moved into new markets.

“Wimbledon has reflected the way society has changed,” says its chief executive, Richard Lewis. “Every year things are tweaked and hopefully improved. But we respect our heritage. I think sometimes things change too quickly. I don’t think Wimbledon has ever been guilty of that.”

Lewis’s relationship with the All England Club is so deep he might well bleed green and purple. When he was 13 he slept overnight on the pavement with his brother before sprinting to get a standing spot on Centre Court to see Rod Laver dismantle Tony Roche in the 1968 singles final. Nine years’ later he was walking on to Centre himself alongside Jimmy Connors, unable to see the umpire’s chair because of the steep wall of photographers in front of him. That day Connors was snarling and merciless, and Lewis won only nine games. Still, he remembers the experience fondly and there is a twinkle in his eye as he relives the experience. After spells at the Lawn Tennis Association and Sport England, he became Wimbledon’s CEO in April 2012. It is a role he clearly relishes.

“I love the buzz of excitement on the first Monday of the Championships,” he says. “It just builds up throughout the morning. Then, just before the gates open, I do a traditional announcement to staff to remind them that this will be many people’s first experience at Wimbledon – or, on the other hand, that they may have been returning for many years – so we must make it as wonderful as possible for them. And then we are off!”

Loosening the mood

Wimbledon has benefited more than most from the frenetic excitement generated by the four kings – Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Murray, who in 2013 became the first home winner since Fred Perry, as well as Serena Williams, the finest woman to ever play the game. Few doubt that the 2008 final between Nadal and Federer, a 4hr and 48min epic of Cecil DeMille proportions, was the greatest match in history. But those things alone do not explain why it has maintained its place as the pre-eminent event of the summer sporting calendar, while Test cricket and others, have slipped back. Smart decisions by smart people behind the scenes have also loosened the mood, and made it less stiff and starched. You only have to mingle in the huge crowds on Henman Hill, happily pecking on picnics, to realise Wimbledon is attracting a younger and more diverse audience.

It wasn’t always thus. The first day’s play on a middle Sunday in Wimbledon’s history, in 1991, was immediately dubbed “People’s Sunday” – which rather suggests the rest of the time was not as inclusive. Patrick Collins, one of Britain’s finest post-war sportswriters, even boycotted the Championships for 13 years because he felt “those running the tournament believed that the public was lucky to be there”.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Henman Hill (now also know as Murray Mount) ready for this year’s tournament.

Many will recognise his description of that Wimbledon in the mid- to late-90s that he gives in his book, Among the Fans. To Collins it was “a place in which fawning deference mingled with simple silliness, where minor royals outranked major sporting talents, and where the audience giggled fit to burst whenever they heard the cry ‘Come on Tim!’”

Yet when Collins finally returned, he found the place had transformed – with “deference in retreat”, a much finer appreciation from the audience of a game played to a staggering standard, and with the public regarded “as guests rather than interlopers”. As he put it: “As one who rejected it for too many years, I sense I may owe it an apology.”

Big decisions

Crucially Wimbledon appears to have got most of the big decisions right. When Test cricket and the Open golf went to Sky they became richer but also more peripheral. But the All England Club stayed loyal to the BBC and together they have mutually benefited. “Our relationship with the BBC has been fundamental,” says Lewis. “They have done a fantastic job for us. I think we’re good for the BBC too, they would agree with that, I know. It’s a partnership where it’s a classic win-win. It’s really good for us, it’s really good for them.”

The extent of that relationship with the BBC becomes clearer on a visit to the Wimbledon museum, where a special exhibition to mark the 90th anniversary together is under way. The first radio broadcast came in 1927, with commentary provided by the splendidly named Captain Henry Blythe Thornhill (Teddy) Wakelam. TV arrived in 1937, with a match between Bunny Austin and George Rogers, before broadcasting in colour 30 years later.

There were also some eyebrows raised when Wimbledon announced it was going to build a roof for Centre Court at a rumoured cost of £80m. But the passing of time – and numerous rain delays since it was first used in 2009 – have shown it to be a success. By 2019, when the new No1 Court roof is finished, roughly two-thirds of spectators will be able to watch live play, even on days when the rain is pelting down .

In the early 2000s Wimbledon made perhaps its bravest decision of all: to slow down the surface. Grass has always tilted the balance towards the attacking player, but the arrival of increasingly lighter and more powerful rackets meant that the men’s game at Wimbledon became too fast and furious, with four-shot rallies increasingly a precarious commodity between big servers. Sometimes it felt the tennis had too much heavy metal and not enough soul. Now, though, the balance has tilted back.

Sometimes it felt the tennis had too much heavy metal and not enough soul. Now the balance has tilted back

“Nowadays it’s not so different that it’s unfair,” says Lewis. “I think it’s now a wonderful surface to play on. I can remember times when the ball was bouncing very low and there were groups of players who just didn’t like playing on those courts, they hated it.”

That is certainly true – in the early 1960s the Spanish player Manuel Santana announced that grass was for cows – a phrase the 1966 champion could have earned significant royalties on given his comments were subsequently echoed by large numbers of clay-court specialists. “I don’t think anyone says that any more, “says Lewis. “The speed, firmness and the bounce of the courts make them a truly fantastic surface to play on.”

Little decisions

But while these major decisions have made the headlines, getting the thousands of smaller ones right is even more important. And for the All England Club this comes down to maintaining what it calls “the list” – a comprehensive tally of everything the public, players and staff suggest they can do better. “It comes from our absolute obsessiveness – there’s no other word for it – to get everything right, to track things and to listen to people,” says the Championship director, Sarah Clarke. “We’ll probably have over a thousand items on that list which can range from very specific – something like a chair on court 18 squeaking a little – to someone saying ‘I’m not sure you have enough food for vegans’.”

The process starts almost immediately after a tournament has finished – with every item on the list having to be discussed and addressed before the next Championships. “First of all we say to each part of the organisation: ‘Can you send us a report before the end of July, telling us everything that went well, everything that you think could go better, any observations about any other aspects,’” says Clarke. “Then, once people are back from their holidays, we work through it.”

This all might sound a little too precise. Perhaps even pernickety. But given the extraordinary logistics in arranging the tournament there is no room for waffly thinking. Around 6,000 staff need to be taken on for Championships, including 250 ball-kids, and 360 umpires and line officials.

But the biggest logistical challenge Wimbledon faces is feeding 500,000 people over a 13-day period. As the catering manager Anthony Davis explains, this makes it Europe’s largest annual catering event. And while staff are trained beforehand, the dummy run comes only on the Sunday before the Championships. “That’s when they play with the tills and cook the food and make sure that we don’t have first-day blues,” Davis adds. “There’s no opportunity for error. We have 50 weeks to make sure that it’s planned perfectly for delivery on those two weeks.”

Wooing China

Not that Wimbledon is resting on its laurels. James Ralley, its head of commercial and marketing, says that the brand has long been regarded as a mark of quality. “And that’s very much how our partners see the relationship,” he says. “Of course it works two ways. We like to always go with the best in class.”

But Wimbledon also appears to recognise that success in the modern world means reaching beyond their traditional audiences in Britain and the US – and attracting more young people to watch. “This is an event that is all about tradition and heritage and they’re really important things for us,” he says. “But how do we make those values come to life for everybody? Tradition and heritage probably don’t resonate too much with your average 21-year-old.

“The same is true in emerging markets,” he says. “People understand that Wimbledon is an important tennis event but they don’t know much more. So we are trying to change that.” Last year it launched a campaign – In Pursuit of Greatness – to bring Wimbledon’s traditions to life, from the way the grass is grown to flowers, strawberries and the ballboys and ballgirls.

Social media is an increasingly important weapon – and one that Wimbledon has embraced wholeheartedly. As well as highly popular Facebook, YouTube and Twitter accounts, it uses Pinterest for Wimbledon food and Snapchat for live stories from those inside the grounds. There are bespoke social media feeds in Chinese, which have 65,000 followers, and a tennis game into the popular Chinese WeChat app. “In China most of our fans follow Wimbledon on their phones, and aren’t necessarily sitting down to an appointment to view. Instead they’ll snack on it,” Ralley adds. “We have to create content that works for them and so do our broadcasters.”

As Alexandra Willis, Wimbledon’s head of communications, content and digital, explains, such projects enable it to show its youthful and progressive side. “We want to demonstrate we can achieve this strange juxtaposition of tradition and innovation, and that we’re not an organisation that is comfortable just always being the way we’ve always been,” she says. “Because we recognise that we can’t do that in the future. And actually there is some brilliant things about this place that it’s really appropriate to bring in some humour.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Alexandra Willis head of communications, content and digital at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.

The digital strategy appears to be working, with Wimbledon expanding its digital audience from 12 million to 21 million during the tournament – a figure that makes it the biggest of the tennis grand slam by .a distance

“It must look like Wimbledon, it must be a beautiful experience, but we’ve also embraced the way the technology has changed,” Willis says. “I was a bit nervous beforehand about how many of our visitors use Snapchat but it has helped us reach a totally different age and demographic – particularly in the US. Because a Snapchat story of 30 seconds can be watched by over 600 million people. The power of being in different places is something we’re very aware of.”

Wimbledon is also using technology in other ways. From this year it will use an artificial intelligence system that is able to automate highlights packages by picking up key moments of the match based on crowd noise and set and break points. The result is followers of the tournament will get video context far quicker after a match finishes.

Playing to the gallery

Despite Wimbledon’s many successes, some questions and criticisms refuse to go away – particularly over whether Wimbledon gives top male players more exposure than female equivalents. Lewis insists that Wimbledon is always scrupulously fair, but acknowledges the big four era has led to some difficult decisions. “If we talk about the marquee matches, we are in this extraordinary period where from a safety point of view it would be quite difficult to put those four men on the outside courts,” he says.

“But that dynamic could easily change. Last year we achieved 50% men’s and women’s matches on Centre and No1. Often the fourth match of the day came on as a ladies’ singles because it’s easy to schedule, you can put them on at 7pm.

“A lot of it depends, ironically, where different players come out in the draw,” he continues. “Because three years ago several of the men’s leading players were in the same half because of the way they were seeded. And so it was heavily weighted one day towards the men and easy to showcase the ladies’ singles the other day. Some people thought: ‘Ah, Wimbledon’s changed its policy.’ But Wimbledon hasn’t changed its policy, it’s just where the best match is, and we’ll do what we believe is right.”

Lewis illustrates his argument further. “I always say if Serena and Heather Watson ever come out of the draw against each other, that’s the match,” he says. “Let’s have a replay of what we saw two years ago. Eugenie Bouchard versus Maria Sharapova, too. I’m not saying the atmosphere between players like that is necessarily a good thing. But rivalries build up and they become marquee matches very, very quickly. And we don’t care whether it’s men’s singles or ladies’ singles, we put them on.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The singles trophies on display in the Wimbledon museum.

Might the solution be starting play earlier on Centre and No1 Court – say midday rather than 1pm – so there can always be two men’s and women’s matches on each day? Lewis looks doubtful. “It is talked about and reviewed,” he says. “But while it’s one of those things that looks very simple, it isn’t easy. We believe in full stands, it’s one of our USPs [unique selling points], and it’s part of Wimbledon’s atmosphere. And we’re very proud of that. We’re not convinced that starting earlier would work well for Centre and No1 Court. And that applies to the public – not just hospitality. We’ve seen times where we’ve had to start play earlier and it’s an issue.”

Really? He nods. “We can analyse the seats, we know exactly who sits in each seat, and we can look at who has got there in time for the start of play and who hasn’t.”

Lewis is slightly more guarded when asked why the Lawn Tennis Association, which Wimbledon helps fund, has not been able to bring through more successful British players. Rex Bellamy, the eminent former lawn tennis correspondent of the Times once observed: “We know how to make money out of tennis players. If only we could make tennis players out of money” – and little appears to have changed given Murray and Jo Konta emerged from outside the system.

Does he really think that Wimbledon is getting a good return on its investment? “Well, we have our role to play, which is to stage the Championships,” he says. “And being a governing body of the sport is not an easy role. But we are very comfortable with what we do, and the way the LTA invest our money.”

Lewis is understandably a little vague on how security will alter given the recent spate of terror attacks in Britain but confirms that Wimbledon will be beefed up compared to previous years. “There probably will be one or two visible changes around the park and the queue,” he admits. “I can’t go into detail but we always enhance our security every year based on the latest information and tactics. It’s something that has been high on our agenda for many years. It’s the world in which we live in at the moment, unfortunately. It’s not new but it’s getting more and more prevalent.”

Trouble ahead?

Lewis is keen to stress Wimbledon is not just a two-week tournament, and is proud of the fact it has a 60-year history of raising money for charities through recycling tickets and reselling tennis balls. As he points out, since 2013 they have stepped up their efforts further with the launch of the Wimbledon Foundation, which has awarded £700,000 grants and donations to 96 organisations, many of them in the local London boroughs of Merton and Wandsworth.

Among the projects that have been funded are one-to-one counselling support for vulnerable women who have suffered domestic violence, and another that focuses on helping children aged 10-11 who are coping with trauma and difficult family circumstances. And as Helen Parker, Wimbledon’s Foundation and Community manager, explains, they have ambitious expansion plans. “We try to help organisations that make a real difference to the lives of local people. But we also look internationally. For instance, we work with Magic Bus, a leading children’s charity that mentors children and parents from underprivileged backgrounds in India.”

But ultimately Lewis knows Wimbledon is judged on the excitement and drama it provides over the two weeks.

After five years in charge at the All England Club, Lewis sees the game and Wimbledon in the rudest of health – particularly with the No1 Court’s roof on its way. Yet does he worry about bumpier times ahead when the top four of the men’s game, as well as the Williams sisters, retire? “I’m sure there’ll be one or two years where the buildup will be: ‘Oh, we’ve no longer got Serena and Venus, or Roger and Rafa,’” he says. “But the reality is I’ve seen this happen before. Everyone says: ‘Oh, it’s the end of this era, it will never be the same again.’ But then fresh stars are born, and a different dynamic emerges.

“We protect against any downsides by trying to make it a great event, one people always look forward to. And, most of all, by making sure the tennis is centre stage. It’s all about the tennis and the great players we have.

“Yes we are in a fantastic era – there’s no question about that, but I just think that tennis will go from strength to strength. And I sincerely believe and hope the same applies to Wimbledon.”

Wimbledon will announce a steep rise in prize money for this year’s tennis champions as the tournament seeks to counter the pound’s fall in value following the Brexit vote, reports suggest.

Weak pound melts the British dream of a place in the sun Read more

In 2016, champions Andy Murray and Serena Williams each took home £2m, from a total pot of £28m. This was a 6.4% rise on 2015’s prize money. But this year the increase could be significantly larger as the All England Club aims to compensate for the falling pound, The Times reports.

The amounts are expected to be announced on Wednesday, and prize money would have to be £2.25m to maintain its dollar value compared to previous years.



Last year’s tournament took place weeks after the referendum’s shock result, which sent the pound tumbling against the dollar. By the time Andy Murray lifted the trophy on Centre Court on 10 July, £1 was worth $1.29, down from $1.48 on 23 June – before the referendum’s result was announced. This means his £2m prize was worth $2.6m - $380,000 less than it would have been on the eve of the referendum.

The pound is currently at its post-referendum level again.

The All England Club would have to announce a significant increase to match the US Open, which in 2016 gave $3.5m (currently £2.7m) apiece to its singles champions. This year the Australian Open offered AUD$3.7m (US $2.8m), which at current sterling values (£2.2m) would push Wimbledon’s top prizes into third place among the Grand Slam rankings. The French Open’s top prize is €2.1m (£1.8m).

In 2017 both the Australian and French Opens made significant increases in their total prize pots, with the Melbourne tournament announcing a 14% rise, with much of the increase going to those bumped out in early rounds, and the Paris tournament’s fund rising by 12%.

A spokeswoman for Wimbledon did not confirm the report but said: “The All England Lawn Tennis Club always takes into account the business and economic context of tennis worldwide, including any currency fluctuations, when determining prize money for each year’s championships.”

The Australian enters the famous race in ominous form and better placed than ever before to wrest the yellow jersey from his main rival Chris Froome

It may be now or never for Richie Porte. If the cyclist is to join the exclusive club of Australians to have won the Tour de France – current membership: Cadel Evans – 2017 is his year. After faltering in recent attempts, Porte enters the 104th edition of the famous race in the best form of his life. When the action begins on 1 July with an individual time trial in Düsseldorf, the maillot jaune will be firmly within his reach.



BMC Racing Team have announced their intention to go “all in” for Porte this year, and will send a roster to match: Olympic champion Greg van Avermaet, climber Nicolas Roche and Italy’s Damiano Caruso are among the riders with a brief to assist their leader. Porte showed ominous pre-Tour form with a second-place finish at the Critérium du Dauphiné earlier this month, but was let down by tactical errors from his colleagues on the final stage. The additions of Van Avermaet and Caruso should ensure BMC can match the firepower of Chris Froome’s Team Sky.

“Richie can win the Tour,” predicts ex-professional Scott McGrory, who won gold at the 2000 Olympics. “What hampered him at the Dauphiné was his descending. He out-climbed everyone on the final hill but it was the earlier descent where he missed an opportunity to get back in contention. Richie is in career best form – he is time trialling and climbing better than his rivals. If he can stick with the best during the crucial downhill moments, then he can certainly win.”

Following several seasons as a support rider to Froome at Sky, helping his close friend win the yellow jersey twice, Porte moved to BMC at the beginning of last year. His primary objective was suddenly unambiguous: win the biggest race of them all.

But the Tasmanian’s 2016 season was plagued by back luck, nowhere more so than in France. Porte suffered a puncture on stage two of the Tour, setting him back almost two minutes in his hunt for the general classification lead. He later ran into the back of a motorbike, resulting in the remarkable sight of rival Froome sprinting up Mont Ventoux with bike in hand. While Porte’s fifth place overall was his best performance at the race, that was still not enough.

“You want to be on the podium in Paris – that is every rider’s dream – so to miss out through bad luck is painful even now,” Porte told Guardian Australia in January. “Finishing fifth was a nice result, but I wanted more.”

Alongside Froome, Nairo Quintana and ever-green Alberto Contador, another possible challenger to Porte is Esteban Chaves of Australian team Orica-Scott. The Colombian rider has become an honorary local since joining the team in 2014, earning the nickname “Aussie Esteban”, and finished an agonising second at last year’s Giro d’Italia.

But while Chaves’s Tour debut was set for fireworks, an early season injury has hampered his preparation. And John Trevorrow, a three-time Australian road race champion and close friend of Orica-Scott owner Gerry Ryan, has downplayed the Colombian’s chances. “I do not believe Chaves can challenge for overall this year,” Trevorrow says. “The Dauphiné was his first race since the Herald Sun Tour in February. But he will challenge on the climbs and I can see him winning a mountain stage.”

Porte and Orica-Scott are not the only Australian storylines to watch during July. Canberra sprinter Michael Matthews has enjoyed a strong season since joining Team Sunweb, finishing fourth at Liège-Bastogne-Liège and winning a stage of the Vuelta al Pais Vasco. The punchy climbs that dot an otherwise flat stage two or the fast finishing stage 11 into Pau could both present opportunities for a sprint victory. If Matthews can show consistency he could well follow in the footsteps of Robbie McEwen, who won the green sprinter’s jersey on three occasions in France.

“Matthews is our [Australia’s] best chance for stage success outside of Porte,” says McGrory. “He has shown great form in the lead-up races and I will be surprised if he does not win something at the Tour. But let us not forget Adam Hansen’s incredible run of Grand Tours.”

Thirty-six-year-old Hansen from Lotto–Soudal will line up on the first day of July for a world record 18th consecutive Grand Tour, a category consisting of the Tour, Giro and Vuelta a España. “While he is unlikely to win a stage, starting yet another Grand Tour shows his incredible strength,” McGrory says. “Adam has moved into the ‘ultra-endurance’ category with this record.”

There are Australian narratives aplenty at the 2017 Tour de France. But if Porte can ride along the Champs-Élysées clad in yellow, none will match that of the late-blooming life guard who dreams about riding his bike.

Having broken into the England Test side the player’s decision to walk away from the game aged 25 caused quite a stir but he explains that, for him, there is a lot more to life than cricket

Professional sport is scarred by stories of ageing athletes clinging to faded glory, or by bleak tales of their struggles in retirement, and so Zafar Ansari stands out in shimmering contrast. Ansari played three Tests late last year, his debut in Bangladesh and two in India, picking up five wickets and grinding out a highest score of 32. It was a start in the hardest arena of cricket and so Ansari’s retirement in April, at the age of 25, seemed unusual.

Of course those who knew him felt no shock. Alec Stewart, the director of cricket at Surrey, for whom Ansari had played since the age of eight, was supportive. “It’s a brave and considered decision,” Stewart said. “He was always open and honest.”

County cricket: Yorkshire v Surrey and more as day-night matches begin – live! Read more

Stewart alluded to Ansari’s academic background, for the left-arm spinner had obtained a double first in social and political science from Trinity Hall, Cambridge, as well as a subsequent MA in history. “When Zafar was reading a novel, the rest of our boys would be doing a colouring-in book,” Stewart said in his homespun way. Kevin Pietersen, who played with Ansari at Surrey, tweeted amusingly: “Way too clever to be a cricketer!”

Over the last six weeks I have got to know Ansari a little better. It is striking to receive some beautifully written emails from a sportsman, whether young or retired, about subjects stretching from I Am Not Your Negro, the recent James Baldwin documentary, to Ansari’s encouraged and flowing analysis of Labour’s unexpected election results. Books and writing have been at the heart of our exchanges, from Hisham Matar’s The Return to Norman Mailer’s The Fight.

It seems fitting that Ansari suggests we meet at the National Theatre, rather than The Oval, so he can talk for the first time in detail about his reasons for leaving cricket. After we have chatted for an hour he relives the quietly dramatic moment when he told his Surrey team-mates he was retiring a month into a new season: “There definitely were a few tears. I was choking up, and eventually crying. Other guys were also in tears. Alec Stewart choked up and Kumar Sangakkara said some lovely things. A physio I’ve known a long time was crying his eyes out. It was tough.”

Ansari smiles at his bittersweet memory. “It’s difficult when you don’t have a Twitter account, and are reserved in your public output, because these are very hard decisions you spend hours talking about with your family. But once you stop playing it’s natural there are lots of things you’ll miss. So it was reassuring it felt difficult.

“It would actually be inhuman to think that you’d just forget. You can’t move away from something you did for so long without an ache. But I’m fortunate this is my choice – rather than a decision forced on me by injury or age. It happened over a long period as my competitive instinct was diminishing – and there was a fundamental sense I needed to be not only obsessive about cricket but obsessive about constantly improving my game. I started to tire of the complete immersion demanded by cricket.”

Ansari’s involvement with England’s Test team underlined that consuming focus – while making him regret the way in which international sport isolated him from real life. “I don’t want to make it sound negative but being an England cricketer requires a single-mindedness about cricket I lack. At Surrey, having lots of disparate things in my life helped my cricket. But this approach was not appropriate with England. The standard of cricket and the intensity of being abroad for 12 weeks, with the press around you, meant I could not be myself. I was missing out on things that are authentic to me.”

He was proud to have become a Test cricketer and Ansari knew he should be thinking more about bowling to Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli than worrying about Donald Trump. But such a restricted worldview did not make sense. “It was a very politically significant time. Trump was elected on the first day of our opening Test in India. I was batting at 10 and we weren’t allowed our phones in the dressing room. I was getting snippets of information from security but I felt so disconnected from something I would have been hyper-connected to here. The combination of playing very difficult cricket, while missing things that mattered so much, made me think more clearly about my future.

“I heard the news about Trump at the end of that day’s play. We got our phones and it was a shocking moment. I expected [Hillary] Clinton to edge it and found it difficult to accept. I’ve since focused most on the policy – like changes to healthcare provision, the attempted Muslim ban, as well as the ramping up of immigration and deportations – rather than just thinking of Trump as the clown he often appears. It’s important to be less hysterical about the person but more hysterical about the political implications.”

Could he talk about such concerns to his England team-mates?

“Yeah, and I think they enjoyed the fact we had conversations around the breakfast table that we wouldn’t normally have as cricketers. They are by no means apolitical but their focus is inward a lot of the time. So we had some interesting discussions and there was a range of opinions.

“I don’t know if there were any people who were pro-Trump. But some were definitely sympathetic to things he was saying. I took it as a positive that there was space for these conversations. But when you have a degree there’s this expectation you can provide answers to questions you have no idea about. I’m just not that well-read so sometimes it was quite funny.”

Just as people expect Ansari to be the proverbial boffin, it was assumed by some that he would leave cricket for a career in the City. “People were really supportive of my decision to retire. Mike Atherton wrote a really nice piece – as did Ali Martin in the Guardian. But there can be the assumption that because you’ve been to Cambridge you’d only give up cricket to earn a lot of money. My girlfriend and friends found that quite funny – because they know how far it is from the truth. Cricketers don’t get paid like footballers but I was earning more than my parents – and they have been academics for 40 years. So if money was a motivation I would have stayed longer in cricket.”

Ansari smiles when he outlines his plans for the next year.

“I’m going to work for a charity, starting in September, which supports young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. It’s called Just For Kids Law and they’re in north London. They work with young people involved in the criminal justice system. These are kids from disadvantaged backgrounds with educational difficulties, exclusions and immigration cases. I’m doing a year there as a trainee youth advocate while taking an evening law conversion course. It’s a great opportunity to develop new skills and, hopefully, help a few people.”

Compassion for others, and curiosity about their lives, beats just as strongly inside Ansari as his intelligence. “There are many people in cricket who are cleverer than me,” he suggests. “I think what perhaps differentiated me from other players wasn’t necessarily my ‘intelligence’ but rather my wider interests. I love going to the cinema, I love listening to podcasts and hearing people talking about politics and broader social issues.”

Did he sometimes feel unhappy as a cricketer? “It sometimes felt claustrophobic with a sense of me wanting to be doing other things. It was a restlessness rather than an unhappiness. I was tussling with it for two years and I worried about letting people down who had invested a lot in me. Alec Stewart had always been very good to me so I was concerned that, because of his own passionate commitment to cricket, he would struggle with me walking away at 25 – and saying that there is more to my life than wanting to be an international cricketer. But it was absolutely the opposite. Alec and everyone at Surrey understood – which really helped.

“Since retiring it’s become obvious that the temporality of cricket is so distinctive when you’re a player. You spend five days a week from 9am to 7pm at the ground watching cricket, surrounded by cricketers. But since I’ve stopped playing I’ve started to follow the game more at home. I’ve followed England the last few weeks – and I’m engaging with it most days. I look at the scores online and I might watch 20 minutes of highlights. So that’s 40 minutes a day where I’ve followed cricket for pleasure. I didn’t do that as a player.”

Have there been days when he regretted his decision? “No. I’ve been back to The Oval a few times, as I’m still involved with Surrey’s charitable arm, and I’ve been up to the dressing room during games. It’s felt very comfortable.”

Ansari can now savour his three Test appearances. “Absolutely. The crowds weren’t that large in India [in Rajkot and Visakhapatnam] or Bangladesh – but they were intense and exuberant. The atmosphere made it special and I am more and more proud of those five wickets and the 49 runs I scored. My first Test wicket in Bangladesh was quite magical and it meant a lot when I was handed my cap. Mark Ramprakash [England’s batting coach] and I had played a little cricket together and he spoke incredibly kindly about me. That sense of entering an exclusive group is something to be proud of.”

Did his more expansive interests outside cricket help him cope with failure better – when he dropped a catch or bowled poorly? “I probably felt those failures as much as anyone. In the moment of failure, or even the day of the failure, it hurt. But I could rationalise the situation a little more easily. I could genuinely say to myself that there are things that are more important in my life.”

Ansari flummoxed many whenever he was asked to pick his dream slip cordon. In 2015 he listed Malcolm X, Rosa Luxemburg, Chimamanda Adichie and Angela Davis. He laughs. “We get asked to do them every year and it’s funny how people pick up on that particular selection. Malcolm X is definitely someone I’m fascinated by but the last one I did included Rihanna and James Baldwin. It’s just fun.”

There is a seriousness, however, to Ansari’s interest in race and politics. His Masters’ thesis explored the legacy of the Deacons for Defense – an obscure 1960s black civil rights group in Mississippi and Louisiana.

“They were more conservative than the Black Panthers. But they were based in the deep south and reflected their geography. The Black Panthers had a more coherent leftist ideology but the expressive politics of the Deacons for Defense were very powerful. Considering America today, with Black Lives Matter, I looked back and tried to assess all the Deacons of Defense had done.”

The world today is even more fractured and dangerous. With a white mother and having been born in Ascot and gone to Cambridge, Ansari stresses that: “I obviously had a privileged upbringing. But I think I look at the urgent questions we face today through my father’s eyes, to some extent, an Asian man and a Muslim. He arrived in the UK from Pakistan in the early 1960s, aged 14, and I always try to consider things from his perspective.

“Society is in a concerning place whatever your background. There are troubling questions about inequality and the atomisation of people – the way in which societies are splitting up socially and economically. There are 3.1 million Muslims in this country and it’s often very difficult to have conversations about divisions in British society after devastating attacks on all communities. But it’s important we keep having those conversations.”

Cricket is a wonderful diversion – and, as Ansari makes clear, it can also play a part in uniting communities. “It was a special moment this winter when we had four very different England players with a Muslim background in Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, Haseeb Hameed and me on tour. They will continue to be great representatives for England.”

Ansari will make his own lasting contribution in very different fields. At 25 it’s impossible to know yet where his best work will unfold – but it is easy to believe that, beyond cricket, so many more people will benefit from his intelligence and concern for the world around him. Zafar Ansari’s real life, after all, has only just begun.

The former fast bowler was the world’s best when he led England’s attack at the 2005 Ashes but tells Donald McRae he spent the peak of his cricket career battling depression and feared fans would not understand

“I’ve been through a fucking hell of a lot,” Steve Harmison says in the deserted bar of Ashington Football Club on a quiet afternoon. “I’ve had the upmost highs and the lowest lows. I’ve gone from being the No1 bowler in the world, to bowling that ball in Brisbane [when, in 2006, Harmison delivered the most embarrassing opening delivery of an Ashes series]. I’ve gone from feeling on top of the world to being in a clinic in the Priory. How much higher can you get and how much lower can you go? I don’t think you can.”

This past week has felt like the dog days of summer across most of the country but, in Northumberland, the heat has been muted. Harmison has dressed accordingly – in sandals, shorts and a long-sleeve shirt. The 38-year-old former fast bowler takes a swig of his fizzy drink as he reflects on a cricketing life studded with plaudits but riven with lasting pain.

Jonathan Trott: ‘I was going back into that pressure cooker, that place of judgment’ Read more

Harmison led England’s attack during the most thrilling Ashes of all, in 2005, and he was part of another home triumph against Australia four years later. Depression, however, always stalked him. “The important thing is I’ve come out the other side of it. If a kid playing cricket now has the same problems I would love to help them overcome adversity. I had to do it myself. I had the best family, I was earning good money, I was the best bowler in the world. At that point [in 2004], I was at my darkest. The fact I kept going is my biggest achievement because you never overcome depression. But if you don’t cave in, that’s a real strength.”

Harmison and I have already reminisced about our last poignant interview in December 2004. He led the world rankings after a stunning year for England, which included him taking seven for 12 as he destroyed West Indies in Kingston with pace, bounce and venom. England were on their way to South Africa, for a tough series win which would strengthen their resolve before the Ashes, when Harmison and I met at Heathrow.

He cried a little as he stared at the reflection of the international departures sign in the dirty window of an airport café. “Today is the day I wish I wasn’t a professional cricketer,” Harmison told me then. “Today is the day I wish I worked in an office in a nine-to-five job. This is the worst day I’ve known as a cricketer. There have been an awful lot of tears in the family today. How do you tell your kids you won’t be home for 10 weeks? It’s just being away that kills me.”

I thought: just bump into somebody else's car and I'll miss my flight and get three more days at home

He was suffering from depression which, officially, was described as “homesickness”. I wrote: “If homesickness is a kind of illness, then Harmison suffers from a distressing form of the ailment.”

Two years before Marcus Trescothick left an Ashes tour because of mental health issues and long before Michael Yardy and Jonathan Trott suffered similar difficulties, Harmison faced torment. He might be the last of this England quartet to publish a book but his autobiography Speed Demons is affecting and moving. It is also alarming as Harmison reveals that, on the morning of our 2004 interview, he had considered driving his car into another as a way of avoiding his flight to South Africa.

“I’d just bump into somebody’s back end and say my neck is sore and I’ll get an extra three days at home,” he says now of causing a possible accident. “But that would have made it worse because I would have had to fly on my own. I never would have got there.”

It seems incredible the severity of Harmison’s depression was not addressed. “I don’t think mental health was highlighted then. It was only later, when Marcus got really poorly that people stood back and thought about it. It ended Marcus’s international career but then the next player came and the next. All of a sudden, people began to understand our problems.

“I was happy to have my depression labelled as homesickness because I would’ve been a hell of a lot worse if I wasn’t playing cricket. A lot of people in cricket knew about my depression but I didn’t want the general public to know. People can tolerate you having a poor game. They can say: ‘OK, he’s homesick.’ But they would be less tolerant of a poor game when mental health issues are mentioned. My fear was they wouldn’t allow me back. I desperately needed to play cricket and, at first, I just thought it was when I went away. I remember being in Disneyland Paris crying my eyes out but I was also doing it at home. I really had to seek help.”

Did it help when he was diagnosed as suffering from clinical depression? “Yeah, because that explained things. I went to the Priory and the doctor said: ‘I don’t know anything about cricket.’ The relief was unreal because I thought: ‘Great, he’s going to talk to me about the symptoms rather than the cricketer.’ He would see me as a human being. I feel the same now. I’d go back once a week if I had to because it helps so much to talk about it.”

Can he handle bouts of depression more easily now? “Yeah, because I’ve dealt with them for so long. I know how to hide in a hole, go quietly into hibernation for a few days. It tends to last a couple of weeks but it’s only three or four days where it’s really bad. You learn to cope and, at its worst, you know the next day will feel better. But it’s harder because I don’t have that release of playing cricket anymore.”

Harmison now manages Ashington in the Northern League Division One. He receives only expenses but the focus of looking after a team has steadied him in retirement. “Until I got into the football I was in a void. Alcohol then played a massive part. You’d say: ‘I’ve not got anything to do so I’ll go out and have a couple of beers.’ I never had a problem with alcohol but I used it to fill the void when I finished playing. It made me feel a little better as I was drinking but I was a thousand times worse the next day.

“My problem was being on my own. It’s the same now. Doing the media stuff you travel back and forward to places and you’re alone in your head. You spend a lot of time ringing people up just to talk to somebody. Your mind is amazing but it can be quite dangerous. The biggest part is you don’t sleep and sleeping pills are addictive. I’ve got off them now but I’ll only sleep three or four hours a night. So I have good days and bad days.

“At the minute I’m quite content and trying to move forward but I still don’t really have a structure to life. Football helps but it’s not a job. I would like a job working in cricket because I’ve got the expertise. I’d love to think something would come up at Durham but right now they don’t know what’s happening with their finances.”

Next month it will be 12 years since Harmison and England were at the forefront of public consciousness, as the 2005 Ashes transfixed the country on terrestrial television. “People were being locked out of the grounds and it was an amazing summer,” Harmison says. “There was no football on TV and we got 8.75 million people watching cricket. It is sad that, today, most people outside cricket don’t know Joe Root or Ben Stokes. I sometimes work on Sky and the way they present the game to an armchair fan is phenomenal but we’ve not got enough armchair fans now.

“It will be interesting to see what happens with the next TV rights. I hope the ECB gets it right, not just from a money point of view because we need as many people as we can to see this England team. These kids are unreal. Root, Stokes, Moeen Ali, Jonny Bairstow, Mark Wood, Jos Buttler. This generation could be missed which would be so sad. I want everybody to watch Buttler at his peak – hitting balls the way he does. I want the game to spread across the whole country again.

Jonathan Trott said 'I'm not a nutcase'. You don't use those words to talk about mental health

“I also worry about the players. I look at this winter’s schedule and Root, plays all three formats. He’s got a baby who, by the time he leaves, will be [nine] months old. Soon after that, the baby is going to start walking and those are great things to see with your first child. Joe’s going away in October and might not come back until May. Yes, the family is going [to Australia] but it’s not the same. I know how tough it is because I was away for the birth of Abbie [the second of his four children]. She was three months old when I saw her the first time.”

Harmison admits there is “a disconnect” between him and his children – a direct consequence of being away so much when they were young. “There’s a little bit of distance because I wasn’t there. I’m probably going to be closer to my grandchildren than my own children. It pains me to say that. On the other hand they’ve had an amazing mum in Hayley. But even now it hurts that I missed the kids so much. One year I spent 300-odd nights in hotel rooms.”

It is surprising that, despite his sensitivity, Harmison should question the mental health issues suffered by Jonathan Trott. He has suggested that after the former England batsman left an Ashes tour in 2013 he spoke like someone who was mentally weak rather than mentally ill. “It’s because of the interview he did for Sky where he said the word ‘nutcase’. You don’t use those words to talk about mental health. He said: ‘I’m not a nutcase.’ To me it looked as if he’d had a hard time on the field and wanted to get out of the kitchen.”

Surely Harmison’s own problems have taught him not to judge other people without knowing exactly how they were feeling during a personal crisis? “I’ve just given my opinion and I really hope I’m wrong. If I am I’ll be the first to shake Jonathan’s hand and say: ‘I’m sorry.’ He is a great cricketer and I think England arguably missed him more than anybody else.”

Harmison’s application for a role as an England selector in 2014 only received a standard ECB rejection email, without any personal response to a player with 63 Test caps and 226 wickets. “I’d still love to work with England one day but I’m not sure the ECB would give me a job after what I’ve said. They chose the right selector in Angus Fraser, he’s got great experience, but I wanted to help and even now, I would still love to work with young players.”

While he waits to find out how his life may unfold over the next few years, Harmison can feel pride in withstanding the black dog of depression. “I tried my best and I didn’t let it beat me. That’s the underlying achievement. It’s not the length of the career, the games played or wickets taken. I had a real struggle in the middle of my career and I came out the other side of it. At the end of it, I felt a sense of achievement. I felt proud of myself.”

The fact that Zafar Ansari dismissed Alastair Cook on his first-class debut in April 2011 probably does not have much bearing on his selection for England’s second Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka. On the eve of the match Cook announced to no one’s surprise that Ansari would make his Test debut on Friday, replacing his county captain, Gareth Batty, and that Steven Finn would come in for the rested Stuart Broad, who is left stranded – briefly, one assumes – on 99 Test matches.

Ansari probably has a clearer memory of his dismissal of Cook when playing for Cambridge University than the England captain but even his recollections were a bit hazy. “I can remember that if felt as if we had been in the field for a day and a half. Cook [who was on 120 at the time] played a reverse sweep and the ball dribbled onto the stumps.”

This was obviously not such a classical snare as the one endured by Ansari’s next victim, which took place a month later at Fenner’s when he had Kevin Pietersen, playing for Surrey, caught at slip for 30. This is not a bad pair to start with especially for a man who admits that he began his cricketing life, rather like Moeen Ali, as a batsman who bowls.

“At university I started bowling a lot and that was what got me into the Surrey side,” said Ansari on the eve of a Test debut, which he inevitably described as “very exciting”. “But I’m not too nervous at the moment,” he added. “I feel as if I’m starting in a strong group. So I feel relatively protected.”

Even though he has not played an international match Ansari is almost making a comeback in Bangladesh. He was selected for the winter tour last year but a severe thumb injury at the end of the 2015 season prevented him from taking part. “I see getting back after the problem with my thumb as a more significant achievement,” he said, perhaps recognising that England were always minded to play him in one of the Tests in Bangladesh if only to find out more about what he has to offer.

They are obviously attracted to the fact that he is a left-handed bowler (and batsman), especially since the likely Indian side has nine right-handed batsmen. On turning pitches it usually helps to spin the ball away from the bat.

Ansari understands that this Test can be treated as a one-off as England’s management team examine what ammunition they have in their bowling arsenal at the start of the tour. “For them it is a way of seeing how I go. If I bowl well I give myself a chance for Test matches in India,” said Ansari.

Being an intelligent man he tries not to overcomplicate the process of bowling in conditions that are likely to favour spinners again. Cook reported that the pitch for the Test in Dhaka was dry and cracked and he anticipated that it would behave in a similar manner to the one in Chittagong – though the overhead conditions may be different. On Thursday there was much rain in Dhaka and a few thunderstorms are forecast.

“I’ll just try to spin the ball and be consistent and then chances should be created,” said Ansari, who seemed flattered to hear that his captain had drawn a comparison with India’s Ravindra Jadeja. Bear in mind that Jadeja averages 23 with the ball in Test cricket having taken 85 wickets in 20 Tests, 64 of which have come in his own country. “My style is direct; I try to bowl wicket to wicket and I would love to be able to emulate him,” said Ansari. If he bowls well in Dhaka he might just have the chance to do that opposite Jadeja in Rajkot in a fortnight’s time.

• Surrey allrounder made his England Test debut in Bangladesh in October • ‘I have always maintained that cricket was just one part of my life’

Zafar Ansari, the Surrey all-rounder, announced his immediate retirement from cricket on Wednesday aged 25, six months after making his Test debut for England, citing a desire to explore “other ambitions” away from the sport.

“Way too clever to be a cricketer!” was the reaction from his Surrey team-mate Kevin Pietersen on hearing the news – one of a number of congratulatory tweets in keeping with the widely known fact that Ansari, for all the ability that brought him 129 wickets and 3,009 runs in 71 first-class matches, had always been weighing up his career in professional cricket against outside options.

The left-arm spinner and middle-order batsman, who in a statement released by Surrey said he is now considering a move into law, had studied throughout his playing career and was awarded a double first from Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in social and political sciences in 2013 and then a Masters in history from University of London’s Royal Holloway college last year.

That Ansari’s decision to call time comes now, three weeks into the county season, is something of a surprise, not least since he had two years left on his contract and toured with England last winter, making his Test debut against Bangladesh in Dhaka before playing the first two matches of the series defeat in India that followed.

Explaining his retirement, Ansari said: “I have always been clear that, when the time was right for me to move on, I would and that time has now come. I have always maintained that cricket was just one part of my life and that I have other ambitions that I want to fulfil.”

Surrey’s director of cricket, Alec Stewart, said the timing was not ideal but holds no ill-feeling towards the all-rounder, who returned from a slightly chastening first tour in which he picked up five wickets in three Tests and threw himself into pre-season to see if he still wanted to continue, only to realise his sporting ambition had indeed waned.

“It’s a brave and considered decision,” said Stewart, who was told of Ansari’s intentions last weekend. “It’s been at the back of his mind for six weeks but, realistically, perhaps 18 months or so. He was always open and honest about it. It was always going to happen. It was just when. I didn’t see him playing into his 30s, maybe only up to 28.

“He’s enjoyed his career but realised there’s something missing in his enjoyment and wants to use his intelligence and degrees to explore other avenues. He is a unique individual when it comes to my experiences of intelligent cricketers. There are some where cricket is still a major part of their life but for Zafar it was just a part of it.”

While Stewart acknowledged Ansari’s academia set him apart from team-mates – “when Zafar was reading a novel, the rest of our boys would be doing a colouring-in book” – he was a popular member of the Surrey dressing room since his senior debut in 2010, with the squad “emotional” when they were told the news.

His thoughtfulness certainly came across during his maiden tour, where he spoke with self-effacing honesty about not believing himself to be a natural cricketer compared with his team-mates and on the subject of being one of four British Asians to play in the same team along with Haseeb Hameed, Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid – a figure that, for the first time, meant the England team represented the ethnic make-up of the recreational game in the UK. “As a collective, as a group of four British Muslims, there is something in that,” Ansari, who father is from Pakistan, said after the first Test in Rajkot. “There’s no doubt that’s really exciting and something we’re proud of. A lot of people outside the group clearly care about that and value that a lot. And that is a good thing in our society.”

On hearing of Ansari’s retirement Moeen tweeted: “What a great guy and a pleasure to have toured with him. Wish him the best.”

Ansari’s Test career, which ended after England’s defeat in Visakhapatnam last November as back spasms forced an early return home, was meant to have begun a year earlier when he was called up for the series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates following the 44 wickets and 771 runs that helped Surrey secure the Division Two title.

The left-armer, who made his one-day international debut earlier that year against Ireland in Malahide, suffered a dislocated thumb on the day of the call-up while fielding at Old Trafford – an injury that required complex surgery – and did not return until the following summer, claiming 22 wickets as the county consolidated its top-flight status.

The recruitment of Scott Borthwick over the winter gave Surrey a second spin option alongside their captain, Gareth Batty, and Ansari played one Championship game – he went wicketless against Lancashire at The Oval – but Stewart said the retirement was not in response to an expected struggle for selection.

Stewart said: “Even if he’d got five wickets and a hundred he’d have still come to the same decision. He made his mind up a while back but wanted to check that was definitely the case. It was a tough decision but 100% the right one for him.”

On Twitter, Surrey’s head coach, Michael di Venuto, wrote: “It’s been an absolute pleasure getting to know and working with this remarkable young man. Exciting times ahead for Zaf to chase his dreams.”

• Taylor wins football writer of the year and scoop of the year •Sean Ingle wins specialist correspondent; Guardian Sport is website of year

Daniel Taylor picked up two major prizes at Monday night’s prestigious Sports Journalists Association awards for his reporting of the football abuse scandal, being named football journalist of the year and winning scoop of the year.

Football is listening on child abuse but took far too long to do so | Daniel Taylor Read more

Taylor’s original Guardian story, published in November, led to the reporting of hundreds of historical allegations of sexual abuse. Last month detectives were examining possible attacks on 526 people, with investigations by 20 police forces who had identified 184 potential suspects and 248 affected clubs at all levels of the game.

Judges said he “wrote the football story of the year, one which made headlines across all media”. They added it was “a huge story with vast and far-reaching consequences well beyond the sport itself” and paid tribute to his “superb, sensitive, powerful journalism”.

“In a very competitive category, the winner’s insight and revelations about the sex scandal that has besmirched football was explosive and challenging,” the judges added.

Andy Woodward, the former Crewe player whose decision to waive his anonymity and speak with Taylor prompted a flood of other victims to come forward, was also present at the awards and addressed the audience.

“Without all of you, this would never have happened. It’s mind blowing. I’m going to try and continue to safeguard children moving forward,” Woodward said.

“This is important in sport. Not just football, but all sports. I can’t thank all of you journalists enough from the bottom of my heart.”

The judging panel added that the football abuse scandal “was a difficult story, brilliantly and sensitively told. The facts of the story were horrifying and shocking but the winner’s style and sensitive approach managed to make these facts ever-so-slightly easier to read.”

There were also awards for Sean Ingle, named specialist correspondent of the year for his athletics reporting, including the Russian doping scandal, David Rudisha’s 800m Olympic gold and his column on an ultra-marathon runner whose cheating was exposed by sponsors.

Judges described Ingle’s work as “personable, with an almost anecdotal tone, which makes for easy, informative reading.” Describing Ingle as “a modern story-teller”, the panel also commended his “style, authority, investigative zeal and compelling grasp of narrative structure.”

The Guardian’s sport website was named website of the year for the third time in succession. Judges said it was “the destination of choice for serious sports fans. Live coverage is invariably elegant, witty and most importantly quick. The site looks handsome, is easily navigable and boasts some of the finest sports journalism around.”

The Guardian and Observer were also highly commended in six categories: cricket writers Vic Marks and Rob Smyth, columnist Marina Hyde, Television Sport for our Hillsborough documentary, Owen Gibson for sports news reporter, and multimedia package for our coverage of Rio 2016.
